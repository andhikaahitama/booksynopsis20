Nakassis explores the world of youth and mass media in South India, where what Tamil youth call &#x201c;<i>style</i>&#x201d; anchors their day-to-day lives and media worlds. Through intimate ethnographic descriptions of college life in Tamil Nadu, Nakassis explores the complex ways that acts and objects of <i>style</i> such as brand fashion, English slang, and film representations express the multiple desires and anxieties of this generation, who live in the shadow of the promise of global modernity.<br> <br> As Nakassis shows, while signs of the global, modern world are everywhere in post-liberalization India, for most of these young people this world is still very distant&#x2014;a paradox that results in youth&#x2019;s profound sense of being in between. This in-betweenness manifests itself in the ambivalent quality of <i>style</i>, the ways in which <i>stylish</i> objects are necessarily marked as counterfeit, mixed, or ironical. In order to show how this in-betweenness materializes in particular media, Nakassis explores the entanglements between youth peer groups and the sites where such <i>stylish</i> media objects are produced, arguing that these entanglements deeply condition the production and circulation of the media objects themselves. The result is an important and timely look at the tremendous forces of youth culture, globalization, and mass media as they interact in the vibrancy of a rapidly changing India. </p></p><p><b>Constantine V. Nakassis </b>is assistant professor of anthropology at the University of Chicago.<br>&#x201c;<i>Doing </i>Style posits a compelling theory of youth culture that draws upon the notions of performativity and interdiscursivity. Brimming with sharp theorizing and creative arguments, it will have an important impact on the study of youth culture, South India, film, code-switching, and fashion across disciplines in the social sciences and humanities. Bravo.&#x201d; (Alexander S. Dent, George Washington University)<br><br>&#x201c;Nakassis&#x2019;s ambitious volume shows the deep insights into politics and economics that careful attention to everyday sociality can yield. The result is both a tour de force of semiotic analysis and a poignant account of lives immersed in the world of mass media and consumerism.&#x201d; (Webb Keane, University of Michigan)<br><br>&#x201c;In this imaginative and original work, Nakassis provides a radical new way of thinking about cinema, commodification, and style in Tamil youth culture. This is achieved through a close analysis of the performative work of citation&#x2014;how youths constantly borrow from film culture just as films themselves are pastiches of other films and ordinary life. Theoretically innovative and ethnographically rich, the book demonstrates convincingly the cinematic quality of daily life and the endless play with identity that citation affords.&#x201d; (Brian Larkin, Columbia University)</p><h2>Herakleides: A Portrait Mummy from Roman Egypt</h2><p><p>Herakleides was a young man who lived and died in Roman Egypt almost two thousand years ago. This multidisciplinary study of his mummy, which is in the J. Paul Getty Museum's collection and on view at the Getty Villa, highlights the funerary practices and religious beliefs of his world. Through state-of-the-art technology Getty conservators, working with professionals from various other disciplines, sought to determine if the portrait over the mummy's face actually depicted the mummified remains, if precious jewels or amulets were present within the wrappings, and if the age of the mummy could be determined. The investigation was carried out without unwrapping the mummy.<br><br>The iconographic symbols decorating the red-painted shroud of Herakleides depict gods and goddesses as well as express a desire for an eternal afterlife. Such concepts, popularly associated with ancient Egypt, remained influential into the time of the Roman Empire. The book concludes by comparing the data from the mummy of Herakleides to similarly decorated red-shrouded portrait mummies in collections worldwide.</p></p><p><p>Lorelei H.

Diodorus of Sicily, a first century BC author, is the only one to have written a comprehensive history (the Bibliotheca Historica or Historical Library) in which more than cursory attention is paid to Persia. The Bibliotheca Historica covers the entire period from Persia's prehistory until the arrival of the Parthians from the East and that of Roman power throughout Asia Minor and beyond from the West, around 750 years after Assyrian rule ended. Diodorus' contribution to our knowledge of Persian history is therefore of great value for the modern historian of the Ancient Near East and in this book Jan Stronk provides the first complete translation of Diodorus' account of the history of Persia. He also examines and evaluates both Diodorus' account and the sources he used to compose his work, taking into consideration the historical, political and archaeological factors that may have played a role in the transmission of the evidence he used to acquire the raw material underlying his Bibliotheca.<br></p><p><br><strong>Jan Stronk</strong> is Research Associate in the Department of Ancient History at the University of Amsterdam.<br><br>"This much-needed and timely work is a model of its kind and a testament to the author's massive erudition and good judgement." -- John Dillery, Professor of Classics, University of Virginia<p></p><br></p><h2>The Fifth Branch: Science Advisers as Policymakers</h2><p><p>How can decisionmakers charged with protecting the environment and the public's health and safety steer clear of false and misleading scientific research? Is it possible to give scientists a stronger voice in regulatory processes without yielding too much control over policy, and how can this be harmonized with democratic values? These are just some of the many controversial and timely questions that Sheila Jasanoff asks in this study of the way science advisers shape federal policy.</p><p>In their expanding role as advisers, scientists have emerged as a formidable fifth branch of government. But even though the growing dependence of regulatory agencies on scientific and technical information has granted scientists a greater influence on public policy, opinions differ as to how those contributions should be balanced against other policy concerns. More important, who should define what counts as good science when all scientific claims incorporate social factors and are subject to negotiation?</p><p>Jasanoff begins by describing some significant failures--such as nitrites, Love Canal, and alar--in administrative and judicial decisionmaking that fed the demand for more peer review of regulatory science. In analyzing the nature of scientific claims and methods used in policy decisions, she draws comparisons with the promises and limitations of peer review in scientific organizations operating outside the regulatory context. The discussion of advisory mechanisms draws on the author's close scrutiny of two highly visible federal agencies--the Environmental Protection Agency and the Food and Drug Administration. Here we see the experts in action as they deliberate on critical issues such as clean air, pesticide regulation, and the safety of pharmaceuticals and food additives.</p><p>Jasanoff deftly merges legal and institutional analysis with social studies of science and presents a strong case for procedural reforms. In so doing, she articulates a social-construction model that is intended to buttress the effectiveness of the fifth branch.</p></p><p>In their expanding roles as advisers, scientists have emerged as a formidable fifth branch of government.

Yet until now, little has been written on how an attachment perspective can be used to actively inform psychotherapeutic practice. In this invaluable work, Karl Heinz Brisch presents an attachment-oriented framework for assessing and treating patients of all ages. Rich, extended case examples form the core of the book. Demonstrated are the ways attachment-oriented interventions can effectively be used to treat a wide range of patients: couples trying unsuccessfully to conceive, women with severe postpartum depression, children and adolescents with behavioral and emotional disturbances, adults with relationship difficulties and work problems, and others. Applications in short- and long-term psychotherapy are discussed, as well as use of the model in such other contexts as prevention in infant mental health, family therapy, and group work. A vital resource for practitioners, this book is also a compelling text for graduate-level psychotherapy courses. <br></p><p>Karl Heinz Brisch, MD, is a child and adolescent psychiatrist and psychotherapist, as well as an adult psychiatrist and neurologist; a training psychoanalyst at the Psychoanalytic Institute; and head of the Department of Pediatric Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy at the Children�s Hospital at the Ludwig-Maximilians-University of Munich, Germany. Dr. Brisch�s primary research is on the development of infants and children with high-risk conditions and the development of attachment and its disorders. He has led longitudinal research projects on attachment disturbances and early psychotherapeutic interventions.

C. Pennington, the Fugitive Slave Who Became One of the First Black Abolitionists</h2><p><b>The incredible story of a forgotten hero of nineteenth century New York City--a former slave, Yale scholar, minister, and international leader of the Antebellum abolitionist movement.</b><br>At the age of 19, scared and illiterate, James Pennington escaped from slavery in 1827 and soon became one of the leading voices against slavery prior to the Civil War. Just ten years after his escape, Pennington was ordained to the ministry of the Congregational Church after studying at Yale. Moving to Hartford, he became involved with the Amistad captives and founded the first African American mission society.&nbsp; He`traveled to England as a delegate to a world Anti-Slavery Convention and served also as a delegate to an international peace convention. &nbsp; Later he traveled widely in Britain and on the continent to gain support for the American abolition movement.&nbsp; He was so respected by European audiences that the University of Heidelberg awarded him an honorary doctorate, making him the first person of African descent to receive such a degree. <br><br> As he fought for equal rights in America, Pennington's voice was not limited to the preacher's pulpit. He wrote the first-ever "History of the Colored People" as well as a careful study of the moral basis for civil disobedience, which would be echoed decades later by Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr.&nbsp; More than a century before Rosa Parks took her monumental bus ride, Pennington challenged segregated seating in New York City street cars. He was beaten and arrested, but eventually vindicated when the New York State Supreme Court ordered the cars to be integrated. <br><br>In a day when most American leaders believed that the solution to America's racial problems was for African Americans to be sent "back" to Africa, Pennington and others insisted that they too were Americans.&nbsp; "American to the backbone," was Pennington's way of putting it.&nbsp; Amazingly, it is the vision that he and a small group of free African Americans held up that prevailed.<br><br>After the Civil War, Pennington took part in the work of Reconstruction in Mississippi and served also in Portland,Maine, and Jacksonville, Florida.&nbsp; Pennington's writing reflects a delightful sense of humor, intellectual vivacity, and inspiring faith through it all. <i>American to the Backbone</i> brings to life this fascinating, forgotten pioneer, who helped lay the foundation for the contemporary civil rights revolution and inspire generations of future leaders.</p><p>When I went to school, "Black History" was not taught.&nbsp; I have learned a good deal about both black and white history while researching this book and the debt we owe to those who, like James WC Pennington called our country to fulfill the vision of the Declaration of Independence: that "all men are` created equal and endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights."&nbsp; That a man who was illiterate at the age of nineteen could be teaching school five years later is evidence of the potential so often wasted.&nbsp; I hope this book will provide new evidence of the need to keep opportunities open for others to fulfill their potential.<b>Christopher Webber</b> is the author of more than two dozen books, including <i>Reinventing Marriage</i> and <i>Beyond Beowulf</i>.

In her introduction Janet Gezari examines Catherine&#x2019;s assertion and in her notes maps it to questions that flicker like stars in the novel&#x2019;s dark dreamscape. How do we determine who and what we are? What do the people closest to us contribute to our sense of identity?<i></i><br><i></i><br><i>The Annotated Wuthering Heights</i> provides those encountering the novel for the first time�&#x2015;as well as those returning to it&#x2015;with a wide array of contexts in which to read Bront�&#x2019;s romantic masterpiece. Gezari explores the philosophical, historical, economic, political, and religious contexts of the novel and its connections with Bront�&#x2019;s other writing, particularly her poems. The annotations unpack Bront�&#x2019;s allusions to the Bible, Shakespeare, and her other reading; elucidate her references to topics including folklore, educational theory, and slavery; translate the thick Yorkshire dialect of Joseph, the surly, bigoted manservant at the Heights; and help with other difficult or unfamiliar words and phrases.</p><p>Handsomely illustrated with many color images that vividly recreate both Bront�&#x2019;s world and the earlier Yorkshire setting of her novel, this newly edited and annotated text will delight and instruct the scholar and general reader alike.</p></p><p>Cambridge Literature is a series of literary texts edited for study by students aged 14-18 in English-speaking classrooms.

In the new 5th Edition <i>Contested Knowledge</i>, renowned social theorist Steven Seidman proclaims the demise of the era of the great &#x201c;universalist theorists&#x201d; represented by figures such as Habermas, Foucault, Baudrillard, and Bourdieu. In its place, Seidman reveals the dawn of a modern-day shift to networks of clustered debates &#x2013; relatively &#x201c;autonomous&#x201d; and interdisciplinary social theorizing on issues such as citizenship, performativity, nationalism, globalization, cosmopolitanism, and queer life. To gain a better appreciation of this new social thinking and theorizing, Seidman hones his focus on discussions of three distinct clustered debates now swirling in social theory &#x2013; intimacy, postcolonial nationalism, and the concept of &#x201c;the other.&#x201d; Scholarly and rigorous, yet engagingly written for widespread accessibility, the 5th Edition of <i>Contested Knowledge</i> offers thought-provoking insights into exciting new frontiers of sociological theorizing precipitated by the emergence of a globalized world.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Steven Seidman</b> is Professor of Sociology at State University of New York at Albany.

What makes this charming edition of Dickens's immortal tale so special is the collection of 80 vivid illustrations by Everett Shinn (1876-1953). Shinn, a well-known artist in his time, was a popular illustrator of newspapers and magazines whose work displayed a remarkable affinity for the stories of Charles Dickens, evoking the bustling street life of the mid-1800s. Printed on heavy, cream-colored paper stock, the edges of the pages have been left rough, simulating the way in which the story might have appeared in Dickens's own time. Though countless editions of this classic have been published over the years, this one stands out as particularly beautiful, nostalgic, and evocative of the spirit of Christmas.<p>Traditional cover with this full-color gift edition in a slipcase.</p></p><h2>Miracle on 10th Street: And Other Christmas Writings</h2><p><b>Celebrate the season with this beautiful and inspiring collection of thoughtful reflections on Christmas from the bestselling author of <i>A Wrinkle in Time</i>.</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> For more than seventy years, Madeleine L&#x2019;Engle&#x2019;s writing have delighted and inspired readers.

Now gleams the morn.<br><br>Rejoice, rejoice, Emmanuel,<br>God&#x2019;s Son, God&#x2019;s Self, with us to dwell.<br><br><b>Redeeming All Brokenness</b><br><br>As we move into Advent we are called to listen, something we seldom take time to do in this frenetic world of over-activity. But waiting for birth, waiting for death&#x2014;these are listening times, when the normal distractions of life have lost their power to take us away from God&#x2019;s call to center in Christ.<br><br>During Advent we are traditionally called to contemplate death, judgment, hell, and heaven. To give birth to a baby is also a kind of death&#x2014;death to the incredible intimacy of carrying a child, death to old ways of life and birth into new&#x2014;and it is as strange for the parents as for the baby. Judgment: John of the Cross says that in the evening of life we shall be judged on love; not on our accomplishments, not on our successes and failures in the worldly sense, but solely on love.<br><br>Once again, as happened during the past nearly two thousand years, predictions are being made of the time of this Second Coming, which, Jesus emphasized, &#x201c;even the angels in heaven do not know.&#x201d; But we human creatures, who are &#x201c;a little lower than the angels,&#x201d; too frequently try to set ourselves above them with our predictions and our arrogant assumption of knowledge which God hid even from the angels. Advent is not a time to declare, but to listen, to listen to whatever God may want to tell us through the singing of the stars, the quickening of a baby, the gallantry of a dying man.<br><br>Listen. Quietly. Humbly. Without arrogance.<br><br>In the first verse of Jesu, Joy of Man&#x2019;s Desiring, we sing, &#x201c;Word of God, our flesh that fashioned with the fire of life impassioned,&#x201d; and the marvelous mystery of incarnation shines. &#x201c;Because in the mystery of the Word made flesh,&#x201d; goes one of my favorite propers, for it is indeed the mystery by which we live, give birth, watch death.<br><br>When the Second Person of the Trinity entered the virgin&#x2019;s womb and prepared to be born as a human baby (a particular baby, Jesus of Nazareth), his death was inevitable.<br><br>It is only after we have been enabled to say, &#x201c;Be it unto me according to your Word,&#x201d; that we can accept the paradoxes of Christianity. Christ comes to live with us, bringing an incredible promise of God&#x2019;s love, but never are we promised that there will be no pain, no suffering, no death, but rather that these very griefs are the road to love and eternal life.<br><br>In Advent we prepare for the coming of all Love, that love which will redeem all the brokenness, wrongness, hardnesses of heart which have afflicted us.<br><br><b>Born once</b><br><br>Born once.<br>That&#x2019;s enough.<br>Jesus was born once,<br>for us.<br>That&#x2019;s enough.

That&#x2019;s enough.<br><br><b>Life&#x2014;A Gift</b><br><br>These are very special weeks, these weeks before Christmas, weeks of quiet waiting, weeks of remembering forty years of Christmasses with Hugh, or earlier Christmasses with my parents, weeks of affirmation that life is a gift and that what we have had we will always have, and that despite the &#x201c;change and decay in all around we see&#x201d; we do have a part to play in the future.<br><br><b>Time and Space Turned Upside Down</b><br><br><i>Avent</i>. That time of waiting, waiting even more trembling and terrible than the waiting between Good Friday and Easter Sunday.<br><br>But what are we waiting for? Why? We&#x2019;re not waiting, as we so often are taught as children, for Christmas, for the baby Jesus to be born in a stable in Bethlehem. We&#x2019;re waiting for something that has not happened yet, that has never happened before, something totally new. We know only what the end of this waiting has been called throughout the centuries: The Second Coming.<br><br>What is it, the coming of Christ in glory? The return of Christ to the earth? What&#x2019;s it going to be like? We don&#x2019;t know. We don&#x2019;t know anything about this event that is new, that has never before happened.<br><br>But, being human and therefore curious, we want to know. We want to know so badly that sometimes we think we do know, and that can sometimes lead to danger and even evil. Whenever we want to know something before its true time, we get into trouble. We&#x2019;ve never learned how to wait. We&#x2019;re impatient creatures. Our impatience, our unwillingness to wait, is all through our stories, from Adam and Eve on.<br><br>The only thing I know about the Second Coming is that it is going to happen because of God&#x2019;s love. God made the universe out of love; the Word shouted all things joyfully into being because of love. The Second Coming, whenever it happens and whatever it means, will also be because of love.<br><br>--<br><br>We express what we believe in icons, which are creative, or idols, which are destructive. But what is a constructive icon?<br><br>Icons break time and space. One of my favorite icons is Reblev&#x2019;s famous picture of the Trinity, the three heavenly angels who came to visit Abraham and Sarah sitting at a table in front of the tent. On the table is the meal that has been prepared for the heavenly visitors, and what is this meal? We look at the table and see chalice and paten, the bread and the wine. Time and space turned upside down. Here, three thousand years before the birth of Christ, is the Trinity, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit; here, three thousand years before Jesus came into time for us, is the body and the blood.<br><br>So what could be an icon of the Second Coming? I think of Creation itself, and how little the astrophysicists know about it. It does seem that there was, indeed, a moment of Creation, when something, so subatomically tiny as to be almost nothing at all, suddenly opened up to become everything. How long did it take? There wasn&#x2019;t any time before the beginning. Time began with the beginning. Time will end at the ending, at the Second Coming.<br><br>On a rare, clear night I look at the stars. According to present knowledge, all the stars are rushing away from each other at speeds impossible for us to conceive. Are they going to keep on, getting further and further away, more and more separate? Or is there going to be a point at which the procedure is reversed, and they start coming together again? Nobody knows.<br><br>The metaphor that has come to me is birth. Our ordinary (oh, no, they&#x2019;re not ordinary at all&#x2014;they&#x2019;re extraordinary) human births. Right now I am like the unborn baby in the womb, knowing nothing except the comforting warmth of the amniotic fluid in which I swim, the comforting nourishment entering my body from a source I cannot see or understand. My whole being comes from an unseen, unknown nurturer. By that nurturer I am totally loved and protected, and that love is forever. It does not end when I am precipitated out of the safe waters of the womb into the unsafe world. It will not end when I breathe my last, mortal breath. That love manifested itself joyously in the creation of the universe, became particular for us in Jesus, and will show itself most gloriously in the Second Coming. We need not fear.<br><br>There are many tough questions for which we have no finite, cut-and-dried answers. Even Jesus did not answer all our questions!

On August 11, 1921, in Birmingham, Alabama, a Methodist minister named Edwin Stephenson shot and killed a Catholic priest, James Coyle, in broad daylight and in front of numerous witnesses. The killer's motive? The priest had married Stephenson's eighteen-year-old daughter Ruth to Pedro Gussman, a Puerto Rican migrant and practicing Catholic. <br><br>Sharon Davies's <em>Rising Road</em> resurrects the murder of Father Coyle and the trial of his killer. As Davies reveals with novelistic richness, Stephenson's crime laid bare the most potent bigotries of the age: a hatred not only of blacks, but of Catholics and "foreigners" as well. In one of the case's most unexpected turns, the minister hired future U.S. Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black to lead his defense. Though regarded later in life as a civil rights champion, in 1921 Black was just months away from donning the robes of the Ku Klux Klan, the secret order that financed Stephenson's defense. Entering a plea of temporary insanity, Black defended the minister on claims that the Catholics had robbed Ruth away from her true Protestant faith, and that her Puerto Rican husband was actually black. <br><br>Placing the story in social and historical context, Davies brings this heinous crime and its aftermath back to life, in a brilliant and engrossing examination of the wages of prejudice and a trial that shook the nation at the height of Jim Crow. <br><br>"Davies takes us deep into the dark heart of the Jim Crow South, where she uncovers a searing story of love, faith, bigotry and violence. <em>Rising Road</em> is a history so powerful, so compelling it stays with you long after you've finished its final page."<br>--Kevin Boyle, author of the National Book Award-winning <em>Arc of Justice</em><br><br>"This gripping history...has all the makings of a Hollywood movie.

The interests of readers with little or no knowledge of Greek are maintained throughout the volume. Jane Day&#39;s translation is specially aimed at such readers, by preserving more consistency in its Greek terms than is generally found in English translations. It thus provides a more reliable reflection of details in the original. There is also a glossary which briefly introduces some of the key terms and indicates how they are translated. Within the articles, too, Greek words and phrases at various points in the original edition are accompanied or replaced in this reprint by a translation.</p><p>Jane M.

From the earliest human inhabitants and the first European explorers to the national parks and retirement resorts of today, this extensive collection chronicles the West from uncharted territory to a well-populated Eden.

This is the first atlas to compile all the historically significant maps relating to the American West; it includes field sketches of battles, the first maps to show the West, maps depicting mythical rivers and fictional towns, and maps showing early conceptions of California as an island.

In Western culture the clown conjures up images of carnivals and foolish characters in face paint. In non-Western cultures, clowns hold privileged status in religious ceremonies and origin myths.

The work lists 185 cultures by geographical area, followed by a main section consisting of 194 alphabetically arranged entries related to tricksters and clowns; the entries, which are heavily cross-referenced, cite the name of the character with its culture or country of origin followed by stories or other information. The entries conclude with bibliographic citations, and there is a comprehensive bibliography as well. The scope of this work is vast, covering clowns and tricksters from the ancient world to the present and including some references to cultures that no longer exist as well as material from current popular culture. As the introduction states: "This volume is meant as a general introduction to both the characters and the people who see the world through their eyes." It succeeds admirably.

Eleven paintings and large-format silkscreens from 2007 that were exhibited together at Galerie Max Hetzler in Berlin are presented on beautiful tip-in color plates that reveal all the richness of nuances in an oeuvre which has become ever more subtle, ever more painterly. This is abstract art that no longer has anything to do with denial, as Friedrich Meschede writes in his essay: &#34;If I should attempt to describe it through language, it seems to me that Christopher Wool wants to give expression to the nothingness before nothing, and to do so exclusively through the pictorial means of the elementally visible, with no terms attached. Christopher Wool neither insists on nor attacks anything. What he does attempt is to re-think the terms you arrive at when viewing his pictures.&#34;</p><p><p><b>Texts by:</b><br> <b>Eric Banks</b>, former senior editor of <i>Artforum</i>, is a writer based in New York. <b>Ann Goldstein</b> is Senior Curator at The Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles.

She shows how each can be applied to a range of substantive topics from paid work, housework and the state, to culture, sexuality and violence, relying on the most up-to-date empirical findings. Arguing that patriarchy has been vigorously adaptable to the changes in women&#39;s position, and that some of women&#39;s hard-won social gains have been transformed into new traps, Walby proposes a combination of class analysis with radical feminist theory to explain gender relations in terms of both patriarchal and capitalist structure.</p><p><b>Sylvia Walby</b> has been involved in developing Women's Studies courses nationally and in Europe, and is founding Director of Women's Studies Research Centre at Lancaster.

In general, it is intended to provide material of interest to upper undergraduate students in mathematics, science, and engineering. Much of this book requires only a knowledge of elementary algebra. However, at some points, a familiarity with elementary calculus and matrix algebra is needed. The practical use of the concepts and techniques developed is illustrated by numerous applications. Care has been taken to choose examples that are of interest to a variety of readers. Therefore, the book contains material of interest to both geophysicists and those engaged in digital signal analysis in disciplines other than geophysics. This book is a reprint of the 1980 Prentice-Hall volume of the same name.<p>Also Available:</p><p> Near-Surface Geophysics - ISBN 1560801301<br> Insights and Methods for 4D Reservoir Characterization (DVD) - ISBN 1560801360</p></p><p></p><h2>Modern Principles: Microeconomics 2nd Edition</h2><p>From the authors:<br>Modern. Simpler. These were our goals. We knew that to reflect modern macroeconomics we had to cover the Solow Model and the economics of ideas, Real Business Cycles, and New Keynesian economics. While most texts now cover the rudiments of economic growth, the importance of ideas is rarely even mentioned. Similarly, other texts do not offer a balanced treatment of Real Business Cycle theory and New Keynesian theory, instead favoring one theory and relegating the other to a few pages that are poorly integrated with the overall macro model. We also knew that our efforts to reflect modern macroeconomics would be wasted if we reached only a small percentage of the students. We had to make the material simpler, more compelling, and more intuitive. By boiling the Solow model down to its essence and by providing multiple paths through the material, we have made it accessible to all principles students. Our modern approach to business fluctuations is also simpler and yet more advanced at the same time. It is simpler because we model business fluctuations as fluctuations in the growth rate of output, rather than in the level of output. That creates a natural progression from growth theory to business fluctuations. It is simpler because we develop our balanced approach to Real Business Cycles and New Keynesian economics within a single, unified dynamic AD-AS model. And no other textbook offers the same depth of analysis of monetary and fiscal policy in response to both real and nominal shocks. That's why we call our text <i>Modern Principles: Macroeconomics</i>. We have taken recent advances in how economists think and describe macroeconomics and we have integrated them throughout the text. Growth theory is given full treatment and it is integrated with our dynamic macroeconomic model. Insights from Real Business Cycle theory and New Keynesian theory appear early in the text, not tacked on at the end as an afterthought. We are certain you will see that this text provides the best coverage of the new principles that macroeconomists use today.<br></p><p>TYLER COWEN Holbert C.

Jennifer Kahnweiler proves introverts can be highly effective influencers when, instead of trying to act like extroverts, they use their natural strengths to make a difference. Kahnweiler identifies six unique strengths of introverts and includes a Quiet Influence Quotient (QIQ) quiz to measure how well you&#x2019;re using these six strengths now. Then, through questions, tools, exercises, and powerful real-world examples, you will increase your mastery of these strengths.</p><p>Jennifer B. Kahnweiler, PhD, Certified Speaking Professional, is an international speaker and executive coach specializing in developing introverted leaders. Her clients include GE, NASA, and the CDC. She is the author of the bestseller The Introverted Leader. Follow her on Twitter at jennkahnweiler.Introduction<br><br> Why Quiet Influence, Why Now?<br><br> Do you work in a company? How about in a nonprofit that competes for funding?<br><br> Do you work in a government agency with contractors?<br><br> Are you an entrepreneur or freelancer who sells products or services?<br><br> Are you in technology, engineering, or science?<br><br> Do you work in sales, marketing, project management, teaching, medicine, the law, human resources, or administration?<br> The truth is that everyone in a professional role needs to influence others. From Seoul to Seattle, today&#x2019;s competitive workplace demands that you influence a variety of situations and people, not once in a while but multiple times a day. Although influence is sometimes about really big issues and opportunities, it is also about nudging change along one small step at a time.<br><br> Noted researchers such as Jay Conger (&#x201c;The Necessary Art of Persuasion&#x201d;) have found that selling ideas and getting people on board is a process, not an event.1 Influence is not about forcing people to come to see things your way but about learning from others and negotiating a shared solution. This approach is well suited to the introvert temperament. It involves patience, planning, and perseverance. If we all think that the only way to get things done is to shout louder and louder and take up more center-stage space, we&#x2019;ll miss the opportunities to listen, learn, and respond thoughtfully.<br><br> It may be that our society is starting to get this message. Extroverts are slowly (very slowly, some argue) realizing that we stand to lose the wisdom and contributions of more than half of the population if we don&#x2019;t listen to the introverts in our world. Since the 2009 publication of my last book, The Introverted Leader: Building on Your Quiet Strength (the first book about introverted leaders), a firestorm of other books (including Susan Cain&#x2019;s 2012 New York Times bestseller Quiet), articles and social media have crusaded for the cause of introverts. I have been gratified to hear the buzz of such conversations everywhere.<br><br> Moreover, even though they will never really experience how an introvert truly feels, extroverts are starting to get the differences on a personal level. They push their pens in my hand to sign a copies of The Introverted Leader for their sons, spouses, and siblings, who they never quite understood. Hope for a broader change springs from such a personal connection.<br><br> Perhaps the strongest driver for Quiet Influence, however, is how it can contribute to success in today&#x2019;s shifting workplace. These four trends indicate that the time for Quiet Influence is now:<br><br> 1. Flattened organizations and complex vendor, supplier, and customer interactions mean that you must, no matter what your position or personality type, be effective at getting your ideas heard. Gone are the days when you can rely on a boss or your boss&#x2019;s boss to make your case for you. You have to establish critical relationships and communicate key messages yourself.<br><br> 2. Going global means that you need to find multiple ways to influence an increasingly diverse set of colleagues and customers. For example, your more reflective, low-key influencing approach will be much more effective with your colleagues in Asia than a traditional extroverted one. You can use your Quiet Influence skills to make a difference with those in cultures that value a quieter approach.<br><br> 3. The virtual world is evolving and ever present. In today&#x2019;s society, it&#x2019;s highly unlikely that you can influence a broad group of people without using digital media in purposeful ways. Introverts, as particularly thoughtful users of social media, may well be ahead of the game. They have been drawn to social media because it lets them use their strengths and better manage their communication. You and other Quiet Influencers who have already invested in learning and using social media are poised to effect tomorrow&#x2019;s change more quickly than influencers who have ignored these technologies.<br><br> 4. Heightened competition for business and jobs means that companies are seeking suppliers and employees who bring fresh, innovative approaches. The truth is, extrovert-centric self-promotion and loud persuasion are pass�. Today, you will stand out from the crowd if you have a knack for building up others and are committed to listening instead of talking.<br> Because Quiet Influence is already what you do naturally, these trends offer you the impetus to enhance those skills. Your time has come. This book is written to help you and millions of other introverts recognize, develop, and highlight your innate influencing strengths. Together, you make up about 50 percent of the world&#x2019;s population, and you can make a big difference in organizations and communities around the world. I encourage you to applaud the success of your strengths and practice making a difference without making a lot of noise.<br><br> I believe that as these trends intensify, the tide will turn and extroverts will want to learn Quiet Influencing strengths from the introverts they know. Many extroverts recognize that they are more effective, flexible, adaptable influencers when their influencing toolbox includes a wider variety of approaches.<br><br> I&#x2019;ll admit it: I am one such extrovert. I needed to practice how to make a difference without making a lot of noise. For much of my professional life, I went along with the ill-founded belief that the Type A approach, with its emphasis on talking and finding center stage, delivered results. I am a speaker, executive coach, and author whose job it is to influence people to try new approaches in their lives. Of course, I thought, that means being &#x201c;out there&#x201d; and being &#x201c;on.&#x201d; I moved very fast, did a lot of winging it, and often found a way to attract attention. As I progressed in my career, I embodied the stereotype of the loud, assertive New Yorker I was.<br><br> Yet I grew up quietly watching people. My dad, Alvin Boretz, was a TV and film screenwriter, and many of our dinner conversations were about people, their motivations and behavior. Because Dad&#x2019;s work depended on picking up the nuances of dialogue, the meanings of conversations were of endless interest to our family. It was not unusual to see my extroverted family of four sitting quietly in Cairo&#x2019;s, our local Italian restaurant, listening to simultaneous conversations around us. On the way home, we would share dialogues we overheard and wonder aloud about the lives and relationships of our fellow diners. The introverts offered few verbal clues, so we had a field day guessing what could have been going on in their lives. Those quieter, low-key families, so different from ours, were especially intriguing to me. What was going on with them?<br><br> I embarked on my career and continued to be an observer of introverts. I was still people watching, and the people who continued to intrigue me were the introverts&#x2014;those people who sometimes struggled in leadership positions even though they had all the power they nedded deep inside. I wrote The Introverted Leader: Building on Your Quiet Strength to give these talented people a guide for being in charge while being themselves.<br><br> During the research for that book and in countless interactions since its publication, I have found myself increasingly drawn to the stories and experiences of introverts. The more I speak with, listen to, coach, and write about introverts, the more I appreciate their sensibility. I have realized that the quiet language of the introvert is refreshingly different from my natural outgoing persona, and I recognize that I can incorporate introverted traits and behaviors in order to have a greater impact. For instance, instead of rushing on to that conference call at the last minute, I can spend some quiet time sitting on my deck watching the trees and reflecting on my purpose for the day. Or in lieu of randomly posting something on Facebook, I can think of the other tasks that await me. Or in working through a sticky relationship, I can write out my thoughts to gain clarity on where I stand.<br><br> All in all, I recognize that a powerful shift occurs in me when I flow into the less prominent side of my personality. When I choose to embrace my internal energy, I gain deeper insights, delve into my creativity, and become more centered. Jungian psychologists would say that I am releasing a potent force by tapping into the less dominant side of my temperament. I simply see that I have been influenced by the introverts I set out to influence.<br><br> Inspired by the Quiet Influencers I have met and the effect they had on me, I turned my attention to the question of how these successful introverts make a difference. How exactly do they challenge the status quo, provoke new ways of thinking, or inspire others to move forward? What inner strengths do they call upon to effect change? What steps do they take to influence others?<br><br> In my professional life, I have interacted with thousands of people who deepened my knowledge of the introvert experience and gave me ideas about how to answer these questions. Class discussions, questions after speeches, and problems that surfaced in coaching sessions have all contributed to my understanding and perspective. In my role as an author and journalist, I met a wide range of introverts and have written and been interviewed for a number of articles on the topic of introverts in the workplace for publications such as Forbes, Bloomberg Business Week, and the Wall Street Journal. Through hallway conversations, follow-up emails, and blog comments, I have gained an even deeper understanding about how introverts experience their world and the ways in which they use their natural strengths to get through to people in powerful ways.<br><br> I have also been fortunate to be plugged into a vibrant community of Quiet Influencers. I specifically asked these professionals from a wide range of fields and organizations about their approach to influence. They often provided written responses, and I followed up with phone interviews to enhance my understanding. In their characteristically humble way, they shared about the myriad ways in which they make a difference with other people and organizations. As privacy-valuing introverts, several of these Quiet Influencers asked that their names not be used. In those cases, I have replaced their name with a first-name-only pseudonym. Many others agreed that I could use their names, and I have included those in the text.<br><br> I have done my best to capture the stories that motivated me as I sought to answer my driving question: how do they make an impact by building on their natural, quiet strengths? I then distilled their answers into the six strengths you will read about in the chapters ahead. In these strengths, I hope you find your own unique expression of Quiet Influence.</p><h2>The Vietnam War</h2><p><p><strong>More than 58,000 American troops and military personnel died in the humid jungles and muddy rivers of Vietnam during the 20-year conflict called the Vietnam War.

Much of today&#39;s interest in the preservation of native grasslands was sparked by this classic work. In it author John Madson celebrates the tallgrass prairies that built some of the world&#39;s richest soils. He evokes brilliantly &#34;this light-filled wilderness of sky and grass, &#34; the flowers that bloom head-high, the large and small creatures living in and on the grass, and the &#34;great weathers.&#34; Today, wild prairie is the rarest of all original landscapes - and one of the most beautiful. In this revised edition, John Madson has expanded his account of &#34;People Pastures&#34; to include studies of prairie restorations. &#34;Be patient, &#34; he advises, &#34;have faith, and don&#39;t mind the dirt under your fingernails.&#34; New appendixes give sources for prairie seeds, plants, and restoration expertise. They also list existing and projected tallgrass prairies.</p><p>Iowa native John Madson (1923&#x2013;1995) wrote about the natural history and resource conservation of rivers, prairies, plains, and deserts. His work has been extensively published in periodicals such as Audubon, Smithsonian, and National Geographic, among many others. His books include Up on the River, Out Home, Stories from Under the Sky, and Tallgrass Prairie.&#34;Reading Madson is like reading some of his more illustrious and heady predecessors in the American experience...namely Emerson and Thoreau.&#34;</p><h2>My Home Is My Castle: Beware Of The Dog</h2><p>Stop foreclosure with a question.

There was no lawful loan made by the bank to the so-called borrower. All bankers, politicians, and judges know this truth, and they fear the wrath of the public should their dirty secret ever become known my a critical mass of the people that they have for decades been defrauding.

This book systematically presents a methodology for doing this. The new edition incorporates the latest in diagnostic criteria (DSM-IV) which have become a necessity for people to use in ordering their ideas about patients as well as interacting with their colleagues. This is true whether the clinician is a psychologist, psychiatrist, social worker, minister, nurse or, for that matter, a non-psychiatric physician. Dr. Morrison writes extremely well. One doesn't need a dictionary to understand the concepts and the suggestions. A decent educational experience in the discipline of one's practice is quite adequate for total understanding of the text. Finally, I want to say something about Dr. Morrison's common sense and insightfulness. In discussing a variety of stressors that may occur in the life of a patient or client, he points out that these could be independent events, possibly causing some part of the disorder or that the disorder itself might cause these events. This indicates both an open mindedness as to the cause of behavioral and emotional problems. I believe that Dr. Morrison's practical viewpoint and intelligence shines through every page of this book. No reader could help but derive considerable benefit and knowledge." --George Winokur, M.D., The Paul W.

Kahn left behind a legacy of great buildings: the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California; the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth, Texas; and the Indian Institute for Management in Ahmedabad. Yet he also left behind an equally important legacy of designs that were never realized. This exceptional volume unites those unbuilt projects with the most advanced computer-graphics technology&#x2014;the first fundamentally new tool for studying space since the development of perspective in the Renaissance&#x2014;to create a beautiful and poignant vision of what might have been. <br><br>Author Kent Larson has delved deep into Kahn's extensive archives to construct faithful computer models of a series of proposals the architect was not able to build: the U.S. Consulate in Luanda, Angola; the Meeting House of the Salk Institute in La Jolla; the Mikveh Israel Synagogue in Philadelphia; the Memorial to Six Million Jewish Martyrs in New York City; three proposals for the Hurva Synagogue in Jerusalem; and the Palazzo dei Congressi in Venice. The resulting computer-generated images present striking views of real buildings in real sites. Each detail is exquisitely rendered, from complex concrete textures to subtle interreflections and patterns of sunlight and shadow. <br><br>Kahn's famous statement&#x2014;"I thought of wrapping ruins around buildings"&#x2014;is borne out by the views of his unbuilt works; his rigorous exploration of tactility and sensation, light and form, is equally evident. Complementing the new computer images is extensive archival material&#x2014;rough preliminary drawings, finely delineated plans, and beautiful travel sketches. Larson also presents fascinating documentation of each project, often including correspondence with the clients that shows not only the deep respect accorded the architect but the complicated circumstances that sometimes made it impossible to bring a design to fruition. Not only a historical study of Kahn's unbuilt works, this volume is in itself an intriguing alternative history of architecture.</p><p><b>Kent Larson</b> is an architect and principal research scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he directs the consortium House_n: The MIT Home of the Future.<br><br><b>Vincent Scully</b> is Sterling Professor Emeritus of the History of Art at Yale University and a distinguished visiting professor at the University of Miami.

Since the early 19th century and the invention of photography, artists have been experimenting with various methods for creating photographs without a camera. At once exhaustive and compelling, this book reveals the myriad approaches artists have used to create photographic images using just paper and a source of radiation. Simultaneously a chronological history and a thematic study, this book explores a range of practices, some of which have been in use for more than a century, while others are entirely contemporary. From placing objects on light-sensitive paper and drawing on blackened glass plates to radiography, photocopying, and digital scanning, this is an elemental kind of photography that repudiates the idea that technology advances in only one direction. By eliminating the camera, artists are able to focus on other ways of making photographic pictures. They allow the world to leave its own imprint, to speak for itself as itself. This volume includes 160 exquisitely reproduced works of this kind. In turns abstract and realist, haunting and intricate, they seem to capture the very essence of their subjects. Featuring artists from the 19th century to today, this book explores cameraless photography as an important and influential medium that deserves to be included at the forefront of today&#x2019;s conversations about contemporary art.</p><p>GEOFFREY BATCHEN is a photographic historian who has published numerous works on the subject and curated exhibitions around the world. He is currently a professor at Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand."...all the pictures are dazzling, explosive and liberating to the medium in much the same way that the birth of abstraction freed painting from its earthly bounds." <p><i>-The New York Times </i></p><br><br>"Opening with a 45-page essay by Batchen, the catalogue is ambitious in both scope and breadth of coverage, providing informed access to every generation of photographers from inventors Nic�phore Ni�pce (1765&#x2013;1833) and William Henry Fox Talbot (1800&#x2013;77) onward. In addition to demonstrating the range of this interesting aspect of the medium, these images happen to be beautiful, so the catalogue is a pleasure to study. Summing up: &#x2605; &#x2605; &#x2605; Highly Recommended." <p><i> -Choice</i></p><br><br>&#x201c;Batchen&#x2019;s book provides a fascinating account of developments in science at the turn of the 20th century in the use of cameraless photography to uncover the inner life of things.&#x201d; <p> <i>The Big Idea</i>, New Zealand</p><br><br>"Ultimately, the success of this publication rests on two closely interwoven components, both well resolved. On the one hand, Batchen has assembled a rich and diverse sampling of representative images, each testifying in its way to the unique creative and expressive potential of the cameraless photograph. On the other hand, his detailed probing of these images, the context of their production, and their significance vis-�-vis lens-based photographs makes it increasingly difficult to continue treating them 'as second-class citizens' (p. 5) within the larger history of photography." <p> <i>Ciel Variable</i></p></p><h2>Illustrated Manners And Customs Of The Bible Super Value Edition</h2><p>This fully illustrated encyclopedic guide to the Bibles manners, customs, and times puts a wealth of information at your fingertips.

Board of Education</i>&nbsp;Supreme Court decision, busing to achieve school desegregation became one of the nation&#x2019;s most controversial civil rights issues.&nbsp;<i>Why Busing Failed</i>&nbsp;is the first book to examine the pitched battles over busing on a national scale, focusing on cities such as Boston, Chicago, New York, and Pontiac, Michigan. This groundbreaking book shows how school officials, politicians, the courts, and the media gave precedence to the desires of white parents who opposed school desegregation over the civil rights of black students.<br> &nbsp;<br> This broad and incisive history of busing features a cast of characters that includes national political figures such as then-president Richard Nixon, Chicago mayor Richard J. Daley, and antibusing advocate Louise Day Hicks, as well as some lesser-known activists on both sides of the issue&#x2014;Boston civil rights leaders Ruth Batson and Ellen Jackson, who opposed segregated schools, and Pontiac housewife and antibusing activist Irene McCabe, black conservative Clay Smothers, and Florida governor Claude Kirk, all supporters of school segregation.&nbsp;<i>Why Busing Failed </i>shows how antibusing parents and politicians ultimately succeeded in preventing full public school desegregation.</p><p>"With <i>Why Busing Failed</i> Matthew Delmont dispels the conventional wisdom on segregation and its convenient narrative of Southern demagogues and Northern heroes. In these pages is a thoroughly chronicled, frustrating history that establishes segregation as a national system and demonstrates its tragic impact upon American education today. This book should be required reading."&#x2014;Jelani Cobb,&nbsp;author of <i>The Substance of Hope: Barack Obama and the Paradox of Progress</i><br><br> "In this important work, Matthew Delmont takes the biggest scapegoat for our failure to integrate our schools, and then systematically dismantles the story we thought we knew. <i>Why Busing Failed </i>dispels the all-too-convenient narrative about the disaster of busing as a tool for integration and instead shows that, as black activists noted decades ago, the problem was never the bus, it was us. Carefully researched and compellingly written, <i>Why Busing Failed</i> is an indictment of both politicians and mainstream news organizations that aided and abetted small numbers of white parents in shifting the national narrative of integration from a constitutional and moral imperative to an impossible inconvenience."&#x2014;Nikole Hannah-Jones, <i>The New York Times Magazine</i><br><br> "Delmont tells an eye-opening story of the struggle for school desegregation outside the South in the wake of the civil rights movement. The Southern campaign received at least moderately positive media coverage. But as Delmont reveals in this deeply researched and engagingly written history, the situation was very different in places like New York, Chicago, Pontiac, Michigan, and&#x2014;most famously&#x2014;Boston. Delmont shows how Northern anti-segregation activists were able to mobilize the 'busing' issue, along with the media strategies of the Southern civil rights movement, to generate sympathetic media treatment. This book provides a much-needed corrective to the enduring assumption that the American mass media were cheerleaders in the fight for racial equality in the 1960s and 70s."&#x2014;Aniko Bodroghkozy, author of <i>Equal Time: Television and the Civil Rights Movement</i><p>"Matthew Delmont's brilliant study of 'busing' upends much of what we think we know about the media and the civil rights movement. If you want to understand where we are today in this country--and why school segregation is so ubiquitous and so accepted&#x2014;read this book. &nbsp;'Busing' didn't fail; our resolve to desegregate schools did.

The impossible and destructive triangle of Anna, her husband Karenin, and her lover Vronsky are set against the marriage of Levin and Kitty, thus illuminating the most important questions that face humanity. The second edition uses the acclaimed Louise and Alymer Maude translation, and offers a new introduction and notes which provide completely up-to-date perspectives on Tolstoy's classic work.</p><p>Some people say <i>Anna Karenina</i> is the single greatest novel ever written, which makes about as much sense to me as trying to determine the world's greatest color. But there is no doubt that <i>Anna Karenina</i>, generally considered Tolstoy's best book, is definitely one ripping great read. Anna, miserable in her loveless marriage, does the barely thinkable and succumbs to her desires for the dashing Vronsky. I don't want to give away the ending, but I will say that 19th-century Russia doesn't take well to that sort of thing.A beautiful society wife from St. Petersburg, determined to live life on her own terms, sacrifices everything to follow her conviction that love is stronger than duty. A socially inept but warmhearted landowner pursues his own visions instead of conforming to conventional views. The adulteress and the philosopher head the vibrant cast of characters in <i>Anna Karenina,</i> Tolstoy's tumultuous tale of passion and self-discovery.<br>This novel marks a turning point in the author's career, the juncture at which he turned from fiction toward faith. Set against a backdrop of the historic social changes that swept Russia during the late nineteenth century, it reflects Tolstoy's own personal and psychological transformation. Two worlds collide in the course of this epochal story: that of the old-time aristocrats, who struggle to uphold their traditions of serfdom and authoritarian government, and that of the Westernizing liberals, who promote technology, rationalism, and democracy. This cultural clash unfolds in a compelling, emotional drama of seduction, betrayal, and redemption.</p><h2>Direct Release Myofascial Technique: An Illustrated Guide for Practitioners</h2><p>Direct Release Myofascial Technique provides a highly illustrated guide to direct release myofascial techniques (MFR) and their application in clinical practice.

However, these companies all adopted specific approaches and principles that transformed their ordinary brands into industry leaders. In other words, great brands can be built--and Denise Lee Yohn knows exactly how to do it. Delivering a fresh perspective, Yohn's <i>What Great Brands Do</i> teaches an innovative brand-as-business strategy that enhances brand identity while boosting profit margins, improving company culture, and creating stronger stakeholder relationships. Drawing from twenty-five years of consulting work with such top brands as Frito-Lay, Sony, Nautica, and Burger King, Yohn explains key principles of her brand-as-business strategy.<br> <ul> <li>Reveals the seven key principles that the world's best brands consistently implement</li> <li>Presents case studies that explore the brand building successes and failures of companies of all sizes including GE, IKEA, Chipotle Mexican Grill, and other remarkable brands</li> <li>Provides tools and strategies that organizations can start using right away</li> </ul> Filled with targeted guidance for CEOs, COOs, entrepreneurs, and other organization leaders, and named as one of <i>Inc. Magazine</i>'s Top Marketing Books of 2014,&nbsp;<i>What Great Brands Do</i> is an essential blueprint for launching any brand to meteoric heights.</p><p><p><b>Q&amp;A with Denise Lee Yohn, author of <em>What Great Brands Do</em></b></p> Denise Lee Yohn <p><b>How will <em>What Great Brands Do</em> help us run better businesses?</b></p> <p>Too many companies waste time, energy, and money on advertising and marketing their brands, only to have their efforts fall short. I want to show a different and more effective and sustainable way to build a brand&#x2014;the way the greatest brands do.</p> <p><b>What differentiates a great brand from a merely good one?</b></p> <p>Most traditional branding efforts create an image to serve as the "face" of a company-a look and tagline to promote a business, or a new advertising or social media campaign to reinvigorate it&#x2014;but these activities simply serve to express a brand. Great brands execute their brands, elevating the brand from an external-facing message to a strategic tool for managing the business. They use their brand to shape their culture, focus their core operations, and design their customer experiences. This brand-as-business approach has proven to be far more effective than "branding."</p> <p><b>What can stand in the way of implementing the brand-as-business approach?</b></p> <p>Some business leaders think of brands only in terms of messages and marketing tactics because that's all they know. Others want a quick fix and would rather change what they say about themselves rather than actually change. Still others understand the full business value of a brand but lack the tools and methods to realize it. <em>What Great Brands Do</em> will educate the first group, persuade the second, and equip the last.</p> <p><b>Why is rethinking our approach to brand-building so critical today?</b></p> <p>In practically every sector, competition is intensifying. Companies must differentiate themselves in substantive ways and deliver real value to customers. At the same time, those consumers are savvier than ever, and they're equipped with tools that enable them to see beneath a veneer that a company puts up. Image and reality must be closely aligned. Finally, advertising budgets are getting squeezed, but expectations for brand awareness and preference remain. The solution to all of these pressures is an integral brand strategy.</p> <p><b>Who needs to read this book?</b></p> <p><em>What Great Brands Do</em> is for CEOs, COOs, entrepreneurs, and other leaders&#x2014;people who have the responsibility, and the desire, to grow their organizations. My book challenges the conventional rhetoric about brands and teaches the most essential brand-building principles and tools for running a better business.</p><p><b>Praise for <i>What Great Brands Do</i></b></p> <p>"With her finger on the pulse of today's competitive business landscape, Denise Lee Yohn knows more than most how to create, sustain, and leverage a great brand. Her writing style coaches readers in a warm and conversational way as she offers up-to-the-minute advice, inspiring examples of organizations that have done it right, and cautionary tales of some who haven't. If you care about building your brand to grow your business, you can't afford <i>not</i> to read <i>What Great Brands Do</i> by Denise Lee Yohn."<br> &#x2015;<b>Ken Blanchard</b>, coauthor, <i>The One Minute Manager</i> and <i>TrustWorks!</i></p> <p>"Every leader&#x2015;from CEOs and CMOs to start-up entrepreneurs&#x2015;will find Denise's seven brand-building principles inspirational and immediately useful.

A feminist and ardent disciple of Mary Wollstonecraft, Hays reveals the lamentable gap between `what women are' and `what woment ought to be'. <br><br>The novel is one of the most articulate and detailed expressions of the yearnings and frustrations of a woman living in late eighteenth-century English society. It questions marital arrangements and courtship rituals by depicting a woman who actively pursues the man she loves. The novel explores the links between sexuality, desire, and economic and social freedom, suggesting the need for improvement in the laws of society which `have enslaved, enervated, and degraded woman'.<br><br><strong>About the Series: </strong>For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics </strong>has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe. Each affordable volume reflects Oxford's commitment to scholarship, providing the most accurate text plus a wealth of other valuable features, including expert introductions by leading authorities, voluminous notes to clarify the text, up-to-date bibliographies for further study, and much more.<br></p><p>The Broadview Literary Texts series is an effort to represent the ever-changing canon of literature in English by bringing together texts long regarded as classics with valuable, though lesser-known literature.<p> In November of 1795, after William Godwin requested a sketch of Mary Hays&#x2019; life, she arrived at the idea of <em>Memoirs of Emma Courtney</em>. Godwin followed up his request with a &#x201c;hint&#x201d; that a fictional exploration of the painful experience she had undergone in her relationship with William Frend might help her to come to terms with it. It was to be an &#x201c;instructive rather than self indulgent&#x201d; work. The resulting novel is one of the most interesting and important explorations of gender-related issues of the time. Emma is exposed to a series of situations&#x2015;motherlessness, orphanhood, poverty, dependence, and more&#x2015;which encourage her to reflect &#x201c;on the inequalities of society, the source of every misery and vice, and on the peculiar disadvanteges of my sex.&#x201d; The novel quickly became viewed as &#x201c;a scandalous disrobing in public&#x201d; but it has endured as much on the basis of its readability as on its pointed social commentary. </p></p><h2>College Physics</h2><p>While physics can seem challenging, its true quality is the sheer simplicity of fundamental physical theories--theories and concepts that can enrich your view of the world around you.

For much of its history, the focus has been on differences between people, on what it means for one person to be more intelligent than another, and how such differences might have arisen, obscuring efforts to understand the general nature of intelligence.

In essays and lectures that ranged from old masters to contemporary art, he combined scholarly erudition with an eloquent prose that illuminated his subject and a credo that privileged the visual evidence of the image over the literature written about it. His works, sometimes provocative and controversial, remain vital and influential reading.<br> &nbsp;<br> For half a century, Steinberg delved into Michelangelo&#x2019;s work, revealing the symbolic structures underlying the artist&#x2019;s highly charged idiom. This volume of essays and unpublished lectures explicates many of Michelangelo&#x2019;s most celebrated sculptures, applying principles gleaned from long, hard looking. Almost everything Steinberg wrote included passages of old-fashioned formal analysis, but here put to the service of interpretation. He understood that Michelangelo&#x2019;s rendering of figures as well as their gestures and interrelations conveys an emblematic significance masquerading under the guise of naturalism. Michelangelo pushed Renaissance naturalism into the furthest reaches of metaphor, using the language of the body and its actions to express fundamental Christian tenets once expressible only by poets and preachers&#x2014;or, as Steinberg put it, in Michelangelo&#x2019;s art, &#x201c;anatomy becomes theology.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br><i>Michelangelo&#x2019;s Sculpture</i> is the first in a series of volumes of Steinberg&#x2019;s selected writings and unpublished lectures, edited by his longtime associate Sheila Schwartz. The volume also includes a book review debunking psychoanalytic interpretation of the master&#x2019;s work, a light-hearted look at Michelangelo and the medical profession and, finally, the shortest piece Steinberg ever published.<br> &nbsp;</p><p>Born in Moscow, <b>Leo Steinberg </b>(1920-2011) was raised in Berlin and London, emigrating with his family to New York in 1945. He was a professor of art history at Hunter College, City University of New York, and then Benjamin Franklin Professor at the University of Pennsylvania, where he remained until his retirement in 1990. <b>Sheila Schwartz </b>worked with Steinberg from 1968 until his death in 2011. She received her PhD from the Institute of Fine Arts, New York University, and is presently Research &amp; Archives Director of The Saul Steinberg Foundation.<br> &nbsp;"Steinberg returns the act of looking to center stage, insisting on it as the primary, indispensable instrument for understanding works of art. In an intellectual climate that holds that reading&#x2014;critical theory&#x2014;is the only true path to wisdom, the return of Leo Steinberg&#x2019;s singular eye and mind could not be more timely or necessary." (Eric Gibson <i>New Criterion</i>)<br><br>"This book is the first in a series of five volumes in the 'Essays by Leo Steinberg' series, which will offer selected treasures, some obscure, revealing the unique erudition and insight of the late Steinberg (1920&#x2013;2011). Steinberg was one of the most important art historians of his generation, but not everything he wrote made it into print before his death. The present volume makes available not only Steinberg's published essays and their subsequent revisions but also unpublished lectures, a review, and other revealing addenda to his life and legacy.

How is that possible? In <i>Reconstructing Ancient Linen Body Armor</i>, Gregory S. Aldrete, Scott Bartell, and Alicia Aldrete provide the answer.</p><p>An extensive multiyear project in experimental archaeology, this pioneering study presents a thorough investigation of the linothorax, linen armor worn by the Greeks, Macedonians, and other ancient Mediterranean warriors. Because the linothorax was made of cloth, no examples of it have survived. As a result, even though there are dozens of references to the linothorax in ancient literature and nearly a thousand images of it in ancient art, this linen armor remains relatively ignored and misunderstood by scholars. </p><p>Combining traditional textual and archaeological analysis with hands-on reconstruction and experimentation, the authors unravel the mysteries surrounding the linothorax. They have collected and examined all of the literary, visual, historical, and archaeological evidence for the armor and detail their efforts to replicate the armor using materials and techniques that are as close as possible to those employed in antiquity. By reconstructing actual examples using authentic materials, the authors were able to scientifically assess the true qualities of linen armor for the first time in 1,500 years. The tests reveal that the linothorax provided surprisingly effective protection for ancient warriors, that it had several advantages over bronze armor, and that it even shared qualities with modern-day Kevlar.</p><p>Previously featured in documentaries on the Discovery Channel and the Canadian History Channel, as well as in <i>U.S. News and World Report</i>, MSNBC Online, and other international venues, this groundbreaking work will be a landmark in the study of ancient warfare.</p></p><p><p>A thorough and original study of the linothorax, the linen armor worn by Alexander the Great.</p><p><b>Gregory S.

Societies have historically provided clear rituals and rules for the built environment. Recently, however, the changing conditions of architectural conception and execution have resulted in a need for inventive, socially alert planning. This study, the first to survey the topic, presents architects&#39; ideas about their &#34;people.&#34; Contributors such as Robert Gutman and Kent Bloomer, provide fourteen diverse essays that look at individual architects--among them Vitruvius. Wright, Esherick, and Eisenman--and their spoken and written images of social life, their design solutions, the nature and origins of architects&#39; people, and architecturally related policy, politics, and movements. An original treatment of an increasingly important topic, the book will be of interest to a wide range of architects, architectural historians, social scientists, educators, and students of design.</p><p></p><h2>The Haven&#39;s Kitchen Cooking School: Recipes and Inspiration to Build a Lifetime of Confidence in the Kitchen</h2><p><b>Named a Best Cookbook / Gift Book of the Year by <i>Better Homes &amp; Gardens</i>, <i>Library Journal</i>, and <i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br> The Must-Have Book That Will Teach You How to Cook</b><br> Learning to cook has never been simpler&#x2014;or more delicious&#x2014;thanks to <i>The Haven&#x2019;s Kitchen Cooking School</i>.

Miriam Silverberg uses sources such as movie magazines, ethnographies of the homeless, and the most famous photographs from this era to capture the spirit, textures, and language of a time when the media reached all classes, connecting the rural social order to urban mores. Employing the concept of montage as a metaphor that informed the organization of Japanese mass culture during the 1920s and 1930s, Silverberg challenges the erasure of Japanese colonialism and its legacies. She evokes vivid images from daily life during the 1920s and 1930s, including details about food, housing, fashion, modes of popular entertainment, and attitudes toward sexuality. Her innovative study demonstrates how new public spaces, new relationships within the family, and an ironic sensibility expressed the attitude of Japanese consumers who identified with the modern as providing a cosmopolitan break from tradition at the same time that they mobilized for war.</p><p>"A sumptuously documented book, one that makes innovative use of the principle of montage to generate informative historical readings of Japan's myriad mass cultural phenomena in the early twentieth century. Both in terms of its scholarship and its methodology, this is a truly admirable work."&#x2015;Rey Chow, Andrew W. Mellon Professor of the Humanities, Brown University<br><br>"As Miriam Silverberg has brilliantly shown here, the modern times of 1920s and &#x2018;30s Japan were rendered in a cacophony of cultural mixing: a period of consumerist desires and Hollywood fantasy-making but also the rise of nationalist empire-building. Excavating its kaleidoscope of everyday culture Silverberg astutely offers a theory of montage for how Japanese subjects 'code-switched' in juggling the mixed cultural/political elements of these times. Utilizing a montage of media, texts, sites, and scholarship, Silverberg leads the reader into the terrain of the 'erotic grotesque nonsense' in a work that is as scintillating as it is theoretically important."&#x2015;Anne Allison, author of <i>Millennial Monsters: Japanese Toys and the Global Imagination</i><br><br>"Unlike other scholars who merely view <i>ero-guro-nansensu</i> in its literal meanings, Silverberg brilliantly documents it as a complex cultural aesthetic expressed in a spectrum of fascinating mass culture forms and preoccupations. With great erudition and humor, she traces the sensory and conceptual modes that are animated with potency and sophistication through this cultural metaphor. This book is destined to be a classic in Japan scholarship."&#x2015;Laura Miller, author of <i>Beauty Up: Exploring Contemporary Japanese Body Aesthetics</i><b>Miriam Silverberg</b> is Professor of History at the University of California, Los Angeles and the author of <i>Changing Song: The Marxist Manifestos of Nakano Shigeharu </i>(1990).</p><h2>The Race Card: Campaign Strategy, Implicit Messages, and the Norm of Equality (Princeton Paperbacks)</h2><p>Did George Bush&#39;s use of the Willie Horton story during the1988 presidential campaign communicate most effectively when no one noticed its racial meaning? Do politicians routinely evoke racial stereotypes, fears, and resentments without voters&#39; awareness? This controversial, rigorously researched book argues that they do. Tali Mendelberg examines how and when politicians play the race card and then manage to plausibly deny doing so. In the age of equality, politicians cannot prime race with impunity due to a norm of racial equality that prohibits racist speech. Yet incentives to appeal to white voters remain strong. As a result, politicians often resort to more subtle uses of race to win elections. Mendelberg documents the development of this implicit communication across time and measures its impact on society. Drawing on a wide variety of research-including simulated television news experiments, national surveys, a comprehensive content analysis of campaign coverage, and historical inquiry-she analyzes the causes, dynamics, and consequences of racially loaded political communication. She also identifies similarities and differences among communication about race, gender, and sexual orientation in the United States and between communication about race in the United States and ethnicity in Europe, thereby contributing to a more general theory of politics. Mendelberg&#39;s conclusion is that politicians-including many current state governors-continue to play the race card, using terms like &#34;welfare&#34; and &#34;crime&#34; to manipulate white voters&#39; sentiments without overtly violating egalitarian norms. But she offers some good news: implicitly racial messages lose their appeal, even among their target audience, when their content is exposed.</p><p><p>"The author uses a wonderful variety of empirical data to track the evolution of political rhetoric about race from the Civil War to the present. This book has the potential to be a pioneering volume, moving beyond other accounts of how race influences mass politics in the contemporary era."<b>--David O. Sears, University of California, Los Angeles</b></p><p>"This is an absolutely wonderful book--a fascinating, well-written account of the author's path-breaking research. It is controversial but convincing and will be of interest to a wide audience. . . . The book will surely make an important mark in political science, communications, and African-American studies. By all rights it should also shape the way the news media cover politics and--as a consequence--the way political campaigns are conducted. The work is both deeply rooted in well-developed research traditions and thoroughly new in what is has to offer."<b>--Martin Gilens, Yale University</b></p><b>Tali Mendelberg</b> is Associate Professor of Politics at Princeton University.</p><h2>Along with Youth: Hemingway, the Early Years</h2><p>Peter Griffin has drawn upon a wealth of previously unpublished material--including numerous letters and five of Hemingway's early short stories that appear here in their entirety--to trace the formative years of one of America's Most celebrated and influential authors.<br> This book examines in richer detail than any previous biography Hemingway's midwestern childhood, his relations with his parents, his journalistic apprenticeship, and his experiences as a Red Cross volumteer during World War I. It sheds new light on his wartime romance with Agnes Kurowsky, his first love, and the circumstances surrounding his wounding and convalescence. It closes with Hemingway at the brink of the literary career that would bring him worldwide acclaim. As the brisk narrative moves from Illinois to Kansa City on to New York and then Europe, Griffin paints a vivid picture of the people, places and events that shaped Hemingway as a man and a writer. This is the first installment of what promises to become the difinitive Hemingway biography for this generation. In a foreword to the book, Jack Hemingway, Ernest's first son, writes that Griffin's "insights and his innate skills have enabled him to bring a far different view of Hemingway as a developing human being." This book, he says, "has shown me insights into my own father's character and behavior I would not have thought possible in view of the time lapse between Hemingway's death and the research Griffin accomplished."<br></p><p><br><strong>Peter Griffin</strong> received his Ph.D. in English from Brown University in 1979.<br>"[Griffin] has shown me insights into my own father's character and behavior I would not have thought possible in view of the time lapse between Hemingway's death and the research he accomplished."--Jack Hemingway<br><br>"Griffin's book provides a bewildering and highly satisfying richness of incident....His scholarship is thorough and his involvement with his subject is so complete and so creative that the reader cannot help murmuring with approval and enlightenment at page after page."--James Dickey<br><br>"A wonderful and intimate book....It brings to life the young Hemingway with all his charm, vitality, good looks, passionate dedication to writing, like nothing else I've ever read about the man."--Raymond Carver, The New York Times Book Review<br><br>"A wonderful beginning...[to] a three-volume biography."--Ward Just, Virginia Quarterly Review<br><br>"One of the most purely attractive biographies I have ever read...A wonderful beginning...[to] a three-volume biography."--Ward Just, Virginia Quarterly Review<br><br>"The most finely textured biographical work yet done on Hemingway...[Griffin] works in the service of the subject, and his almost boyish ingenuousness fits extraordinarily well with Hemingway's all-American story.

Here at last is the third volume of this magisterial work. <br> Ranging from 1904 to 1907, it explores Mahler's final years as administrator, producer, and conductor of the Vienna Opera. It was a time of intense inner struggle, with Mahler's energy and creative powers drained by the competing demands of running the Hofoper and struggling for recognition as a composer. And they were tragic years as well, especially 1907, Mahler's last year in Vienna, when the death of his daughter and the diagnosis of heart disease forced him to leave the Opera. Throughout the book, de La Grange offers true-to-life portraits of Mahler the human being, the family man, and the composer, and he weaves in innumerable testimonies and anecdotes that throw new light on the great composer's complex personality. <br> The product of forty years of research, here is the definitive study of a musical giant. It is, as <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> said of volume two, "a work of the first importance, one that nobody seriously interested in Mahler can possibly afford to skip."<br></p><p><br><strong>Henry-Louis de La Grange</strong> is President of the Gustav Mahler Musical Library, Paris. He is also a chevalier of the Order of the Legion d'honneur, and an officer of the Ordre du Merite.<br>A masterly deployment of every retrievable fact about the driven Austrian composer-conductor of genius (18601911) during these tumultuous years. De La Grange (president, Gustav Mahler Musical Library, Paris) takes up directly from Vol. 2 (1995; Vol. 1, 1973) with Mahlers struggles to reenergize the fractious Hofoperthe Vienna Operathe court-sponsored repertory company he had directed since 1897. Provocative productions are revived via eye-catching descriptions; thumbnail portraits reanimate Viennas singers, musicians, stagefolk, and bureaucrats. Able to compose only during vacations, in this brief span Mahler created the prodigious, forward-looking Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth symphonies, granted elaborate analyses in an appendix. Memoirs and interviews testify how this Napoleon of the baton tirelessly rehearsed his works and others, old and new, contending, Tradition is nothing else than sloppiness. Every performance is chronicled, thanks to the periods florid prolix journalism (often marred by Austrias endemic anti-Semitism), castigating his failures and successes alike. No wonder that, despite prescient champions, Mahler developed a persecution complex, lamenting he would be happy, oh happy to be a shoemaker! The biographer painstakingly reassembles Mahlers paradoxical character, intricate as his art, straightening the record about his relations with colleague and rival Richard Strauss; his problematical marriage to the complex and disconcerting Alma Schindler, 19 years his junior; and the fatal illness in late 1907 of his daughter, Maria, age four and a half. Anecdotes, aphorisms, and letters enliven the narratives progress toward the frustrated directors resignation from the Hofoper. Once Vol. 4 appears (following Mahler to New York to conduct and the diagnosis of the heart condition that led to his death at 50), de La Grange will have spent as long researching Mahlers life as it took to live it. A life-and-times motherlode for the aficionado; a requisite for performing-arts collections; a monument that will endure.

The diverse tales selected for this volume display the astonishing virtuosity of Rudyard Kipling s early writings. A Nobel prize-winner, Kipling was phenomenally productive and imaginative, displaying a literary mastery of idioms, technology and technical terms, exotic locations, and social range. He gained immense popularity, becoming (as these stories indicate) the knowledgeable spokesman for a wide public. Later, although Kipling s right-wing views increasingly incurred hostility, his creativity remained formidable. In this rich collection, we encounter bold realism, poignant nostalgia, dark comedy, the vividly horrific, the exuberantly fanciful and the disturbingly uncanny.</p><p>&#39;The Man Who Would be King&#39; is the story of two British vagabonds who set off to establish a small kingdom among primitive tribesmen in Afghanistan. Only one of the men returns, and his condition is so bad that the newspaperman-narrator barely recognizes him.This collection brings together seventeen of Kipling&#39;s early stories, written between 1885 and 1888, when Kipling was working as a journalist in India. The stories include: &#39;The Phantom Rickshaw, &#39; &#39;Baa Baa, Black Sheep, &#39; &#39;At the Pit&#39;s Mouth, &#39; &#39;A Wayside Comedy, &#39; &#39;Gemini, &#39; &#39;The Strange Ride of Morrowbie Jukes, &#39; &#39;At Twenty-Two, &#39; and &#39;With the Main Guard.&#39;Audiobook read by Fred Williams.Rudyard Kipling was a famous British author who wrote about 19th century India.</p><h2>Site Planning &amp; Design: ARE Sample Problems and Practice Exam, 2nd Ed</h2><p><b>Successfully Prepare for the Site Planning &amp; Design Division of the ARE</b><br><br>Get the realistic problem-solving practice you need to pass the Site Planning &amp; Design division of the ARE with <i>Site Planning &amp; Design: ARE Sample Problems and Practice Exam</i>.<br><br>63 challenging sample problems are presented in the same formats as the problems on the exam, including multiple choice, check all that apply, and fill in the blank.

These "pictures of the floating world" were created by artists and craftsmen of plebeian or low samurai background. The prints depict scenes from the everyday life and entertainments of the urban classes, and their popularity lay among these same townspeople.<br>Ukiyo-e was successor to previous aristocratic traditions and represents the last flowering of traditional pictorial art before Japan entered the modern era. Outside Japan, it was ukiyo-e that was discovered in the mid-nineteenth century by such artists as Whistler, Manet, Degas, and van Gogh, creating an era of "Japanism" that was to have a lasting effect on the art of the West.<br>The present volume offers a comprehensive survey of the history of ukiyo-e, from its origins in lavish works commissioned by aristocratic patrons in the sixteenth century, through its apogee at the end of the eighteenth, to its decline and demise in the last years of the nineteenth century. Social conditions, printing techniques, styles, artists, engravers, printers, and the tastes of the public itself - all are discussed as the story of ukiyo-e unfolds. In addition to the overview provided in the text, detailed commentaries of the prints and their subjects are provided. As a result, the reader becomes familiar not only with the history of ukiyo-e, an art of universal significance, but also with the colorful urban culture of which it is a remarkable record.</p><p><br>Born in Tokyo in 1941, TADASHI KOBAYASHI graduated from the University of Tokyo, then went on to serve as a lecturer at the University of Nagoya and as curator at the Tokyo National Museum.

A spectacular feat of individual daring and collective technological accomplishment, Charles Lindbergh's flight from New York to Paris ushered in the modern age of commercial aviation. <br><br>In <em>The Flight of the Century</em>, Thomas Kessner takes a fresh look at one of America's greatest moments, explaining how what was essentially a publicity stunt became a turning point in history. Kessner vividly recreates the flight itself and the euphoric reaction to it on both sides of the Atlantic, and argues that Lindbergh's amazing feat occurred just when the world--still struggling with the disillusionment of WWI--desperately needed a hero to restore a sense of optimism and innocence. Kessner also shows how new forms of mass media made Lindbergh into the most famous international celebrity of his time, casting him in the role of a humble yet dashing American hero of rural origins and traditional values. Much has been made of Lindbergh's personal integrity and his refusal to cash in on his fame, but Kessner reveals that Lindbergh was closely allied with, and managed by, a group of powerful businessmen--Harry Guggenheim, Dwight Morrow, and Henry Breckenridge chief among them--who sought to exploit aviation for mass transport and massive profits. Their efforts paid off as commercial air traffic soared from 6,000 passengers in 1926 to 173,000 passengers in 1929. Kessner's book is the first to fully explore Lindbergh's central role in promoting the airline industry--the rise of which has influenced everything from where we live to how we wage war and do business.<br></p><p><br><strong>Thomas Kessner</strong> is Distinguished Professor of History at the City University of New York Graduate Center. He is the author of many books, including <em>Capital City: New York City and the Men Behind America's Rise to Dominance, 1860-1900</em> and <em>Fiorello H. LaGuardia and the Making of Modern New York</em>, which was a <em>New York Times</em> Notable Book.<br><br>"Kessner's fresh perspective breathes new life into Lindbergh's tale."--David Cohen, <em>Philadelphia Inquirer</em> <br><p></p><br>"It's difficult to imagine how anything new could be written about Charles Lindbergh. But Thomas Kessner has examined his subject more deeply than any other biographer....Kessner weaves a fascinating tale, chronicling Lindy's many accomplishments but also revealing someone who clearly never appreciated the full extent of his notoriety."--<em>Aviation History</em><p></p><br>"Proving again that true tales are every bit as strange and sometimes even more compelling than fictional ones, Thomas Kessner's <em>The Flight of the Century</em> not only evokes a critical moment in our history, but re-introduces an iconic American whom we thought we knew, but really didn't. This is great history--a fascinating story told by a masterful storyteller."--David Nasaw, author of <em>Andrew Carnegie</em> and <em>The Chief: The Life of William Randolph Hearst</em><p></p><br>"In his brilliant and sensitively drawn portrait of Charles Lindbergh, Thomas Kessner not only brings this deeply flawed American hero to life; he vividly reconstructs the historical context in which the aviator's life played out. Kessner deftly reveals how and why Lindbergh and his flight became a juggernaut through the years of prosperity and depression, the battle over fascism and the fear of communism, and the moral and social dilemmas prompted by science and technological advances. This book is a must for anyone hoping to understand modern America."--Carol Berkin, author of <em>Revolutionary</em> <em>Mothers</em> and <em>Civil War Wives</em><p></p><br>"The splendid, far-reaching analysis of one of American history's most enigmatic figures will satisfy the scholar, and the deft use of colorful anecdotes will appeal to general readers.

To address this concern, management education must be more than the transfer of skills. It should be a moral endeavor, a passing-on from one generation to the next of a kind of wisdom about responsible moral commitment in complex contexts. Faculty at professional schools have an opportunity and a responsibility to help students connect their capacity for high achievement to a sense of purpose and a set of principles. This book is an explanation of how one business school is trying to place leadership, ethics, and corporate responsibility at the center of its mission. It is a call to rebalance the educational trilogy of values, knowledge, and skills.<p><b>Can Ethics Be Taught?</b> traces the evolution, strategy, and implementation of the pathbreaking Leadership, Ethics, and Corporate Responsibility program at the Harvard Business School. It describes in detail the origins of the initiative for this program, the sophisticated research that went into the approach, timing, and appropriate interventions for working with students and faculty, as well as the design of the program strategy itself. The accomplishments of this program have been substantial; and the lessons drawn from the experience of the Harvard Business School can prove instructive to other professional schools-in such fields as management, public administration, and law-and to corporate leaders as they design and implement their own programs on leadership, ethics, and responsibility. <br></p></p><p>Sharon Daloz Parks is Director of Leadership for the New Commons&#x2014;an initiative of the Whidbey Institute in Clinton, WA.

Does time really flow, or is that simply an illusion? Did time have a beginning? What does it mean to say that time has a direction? Does space have boundaries, or is it infinite? Is change really possible? Could space and time exist in the absence of any objects or events? What, in the end, are space and time? Do they really exist, or are they simply the constructions of our minds?<br> Robin Le Poidevin provides a clear, witty, and stimulating introduction to these deep questions and many other mind-boggling puzzles and paradoxes. He gives a vivid sense of the difficulties raised by our ordinary ideas about space and time, but he also gives us the basis to think about these problems independently, avoiding large amounts of jargon and technicality. His book is an invitation to think philosophically rather than a sustained argument for particular conclusions, but Le Poidevin does advance and defend a number of controversial views. He argues, for example, that time does not actually flow, that it is possible for space and time to be both finite and yet be without boundaries, and that causation is the key to an understanding of one of the deepest mysteries of time: its direction.<br> Drawing on a variety of vivid examples from science, history, and literature, <em>Travels in Four Dimensions</em> brings to life some of the most profound questions imaginable.<br></p><p><br><strong>Robin Le Poidevin</strong> is Professor of Metaphysics at the University of Leeds.

Our refrigerator alerts us to buy milk on the way home. A package of cookies on the supermarket shelf suggests that we buy it, based on past purchases. The cookies themselves are on the shelf because of a &#x201c;smart&#x201d; supply chain. When we get home, the thermostat has already adjusted the temperature so that it's toasty or bracing, whichever we prefer.

Smart phones, cloud computing, RFID (radio-frequency identification) technology, sensors, and miniaturization are converging to make possible a new generation of embedded and immersive technology. Greengard traces the origins of the IoT from the early days of personal computers and the Internet and examines how it creates the conceptual and practical framework for a connected world. He explores the industrial Internet and machine-to-machine communication, the basis for smart manufacturing and end-to-end supply chain visibility; the growing array of smart consumer devices and services&#x2015;from Fitbit fitness wristbands to mobile apps for banking; the practical and technical challenges of building the IoT; and the risks of a connected world, including a widening digital divide and threats to privacy and security.

These fifteen verses have shaped worship practices, church structures, church leadership, marriages, and even relationships between men and women in general. They have contributed to practices that have consistently placed women in a subordinate role to men, and have been used to justify the idea that a woman should not occupy a leadership or teaching position without being under the authority or &#34;covering&#34; of a man. It is strange, therefore, that academics and pastors alike continue to note how confusing and difficult it continues to be to make sense of these very verses. In this little book, Lucy Peppiatt not only highlights the problems associated with using this text to justify the subordination of women, but offers a clear and plausible re-reading of the text that paints the apostle Paul as a radical, visionary, church planter who championed women in all forms of leadership.</p><p>Lucy Peppiatt is the Principal of Westminster Theological Centre and the author of Women and Worship at Corinth: Paul&#39;s Rhetorical Arguments in 1 Corinthians (2015).</p><h2>Highballs for Breakfast</h2><p>No writer knew better than PG Wodehouse how a drink can lift the spirits &#x2013; and he was a master at the high comic effects of having a few too many. <i>Highballs for Breakfast </i>is a handpicked selection of wit, wisdom and comic moments from Wodehouse&#x2019;s work that involve getting pickled or plastered, or lathered or sozzled, and getting in and out of all manner of scrapes.<br>If some great writers dwelled on the darker side of drinking, Wodehouse was concerned with the pure pleasure to be had from &#x2018;the magic bottle&#x2019; and getting outside of the contents of a tall glass. His imperishable writing displays a well-turned appreciation for all kinds of booze &#x2013; cocktails, champagne, port, whiskey and brandy (with soda, of course); but also the humble pint, and even the infamous poteen. <p>This sparkling collection captures Wodehouse at his best on being terribly thirsty, or drowning one&#x2019;s sorrows, or knocking one back for Dutch courage.

His revolt (1400-1409) was the last major Welsh rebellion against English rule. It established a measure of unity such as Wales had never previously experienced and generated a remarkable vision of Wales as an independent country with its own native prince, its own church, and its own universities. In the event, Owain&#39;s rebellion was defeated or, perhaps more correctly, burnt itself out. But Owain himself was not captured; and soon after his death he became a legendary hero among the Welsh people. In more recent times he has come to be regarded as the father of modern Welsh nationalism. Written by one of Britain&#39;s leading medieval historians, this book will appeal to those who are fascinated by national heroes in all periods.

A first-rate philosopher in his own right, Kaufmann here provides the fullest account of his views on religion. Although he considered himself a heretic, he was not immune to the wellsprings and impulses from which religion originates, declaring it among the most vital and radical expressions of the human mind. Beginning with an autobiographical prologue that traces his evolution from religious believer to "heretic," the book touches on theology, organized religion, morality, suffering, and death&#x2015;all examined from the perspective of a "quest for honesty." Kaufmann also subjects philosophy's faith in truth, reason, and absolute morality to the same heretical treatment. The resulting exploration of the faiths of a nonbeliever in a secular age is as fresh and challenging as when it was first published.</p><p>In a new foreword, Stanley Corngold vividly describes the intellectual and biographical milieu of Kaufmann&#x2019;s provocative book.</p></p><p><b>Walter Kaufmann</b> (1921&#x2013;1980) was the Stuart Professor of Philosophy at Princeton University, where he taught for more than thirty years.

(<i>Life</i>)<br><br>"The case against organized religion has seldom been so cogently put." (<i>Newsweek</i>)<br><br>"The book is a demonstration of Kaufmann's high spirits as well as his learning and cogency.

What has happened these past few years is well known. Why it happened continues to puzzle. Celebrated Slate columnist Fred Kaplan explains the grave misconceptions that enabled George W. Bush and his aides to get so far off track, and traces the genesis and evolution of these ideas from the era of Nixon through Reagan to the present day.</p><p><p>"This is the inside history of our time, told with precision and confidence by an author who knows where the secrets are kept&#x2014;and also that the most powerful and dangerous weapon in Washington, D.C., is a new idea."<br>&#x2014;THomas E. Ricks, author of Fiasco: THe American military adventure in iraq and making the corps</p><p>"Fred Kaplan has long been one of our most incisive thinkers about strategic issues.

It's a bracing read." <br>&#x2014;Walter Isaacson, author of Einstein and The Wise Men</p><p>"In his Slate chronicles through the Iraq War years, Fred Kaplan consistenly outshone other analysts with his explanation of what was going wrong, and why. In this engrossing and completely new work, he tells the story of the little-known theorists who have shaped much of the world's recent history. For me this book was full of revelations."<br>&#x2014;James fallows, national correspondent, the atlantic monthly</p><p>"With a series of deft, highly readable and utterly fair strokes, Fred Kaplan has collared George W. Bush's quest for absolute power and universal values. And by hanging those failed ideas up there for all to see, Kaplan gives the next president running room to pursue a sensible foreign policy."<br>&#x2014;Leslie h. gelb, president-emeritus of the council on foreign relations and former columnist for the new york times</p><p>"Fred Kaplan's Daydream Believers takes us to the years before 9/11 and shows that the misguided concepts and looney tunes of George Bush's failed war on terror had its beginnings long before Osama bin Laden came on the scene.

Like a master archaeologist who can see through the shards and stones of a dig to reconstruct the culture of the city below, Kaplan lays out all the failures, omissions, and delusions of Bush administration officials.

In Daydream Believers, celebrated Slate columnist Fred Kaplan&#x2014;"one of our most incisive thinkers about strategic issues," according to Walter Isaacson&#x2014;combines in-depth reporting and razor-sharp analysis to explain just how America got so far off track. Kaplan traces the origins of these catastrophic ideas, how they developed from as far back as fifty years ago, and how our next leaders can awake from the daydreams and see the world as it is.</p></p><h2>A Course in Combinatorics</h2><p>Combinatorics, a subject dealing with ways of arranging and distributing objects, involves ideas from geometry, algebra, and analysis. The breadth of the theory is matched by that of its applications, which include topics as diverse as codes, circuit design and algorithm complexity. It has thus become an essential tool in many scientific fields. In this second edition the authors have made the text as comprehensive as possible, dealing in a unified manner with such topics as graph theory, extremal problems, designs, colorings, and codes. The depth and breadth of the coverage make the book a unique guide to the whole of the subject. It is ideal for courses on combinatorical mathematics at the advanced undergraduate or beginning graduate level, and working mathematicians and scientists will also find it a valuable introduction and reference.</p><p>This is the second edition of a popular text on combinatorics, a subject dealing with ways of arranging and distributing objects, and which involves ideas from geometry, algebra and analysis.

In his introduction to <i>The Mathematical Experience</i>, Gian-Carlo Rota notes that instead, "a mathematician's work is mostly a tangle of guesswork, analogy, wishful thinking and frustration, and proof ... is more often than not a way of making sure that our minds are not playing tricks." Philip Davis and Reuben Hersh discuss everything from the nature of proof to the Euclid myth, and mathematical aesthetics to non-Cantorian set theory. They make a convincing case for the idea that mathematics is not about eternal reality, but comprises "true facts about imaginary objects" and belongs among the human sciences.Phillip J.

It is at the same time a history of language, a guide to foreign tongues, and a method for learning them. It shows, through basic vocabularies, family resemblances of languages -- Teutonic, Romance, Greek -- helpful tricks of translation, key combinations of roots and phonetic patterns. It presents by common-sense methods the most helpful approach to the mastery of many languages; it condenses vocabulary to a minimum of essential words; it simplifies grammar in an entirely new way; and it teaches a language as it is actually used in everyday life.Frederick Bodmer is a distinguished Swiss philologist.</p><h2>Philippians For You (God&#39;s Word For You)</h2><p>The book of Philippians is about how to live with great joy and firm faith even when circumstances are hard.

A must-have for all Twain collectors, <i>The Quotable Mark Twain</i> is filled with his opinions about the people he knew, the places he's been, and the books he wrote, as well as more far-ranging topics, such as writers, billiards, smoking, his family, and more. The book also includes 150 illustrations taken from the original editions of Twain's publications, source citations for each quotation, an annotated bibliography, and a complete index.</p></p><p>From the author of the encyclopedic <i>Mark Twain A to Z</i> comes Mark Twain, accident ("the greatest of all the inventors") to Zola ("The manliest man in France"). This is certainly not the first compilation of Twain witticisms. Nor is it the second or third. But of the 1,800-plus quotations included in <i>The Quotable Mark Twain</i>, more than half do not appear in any other collection. This is because the book's editor, R. Kent Rasmussen, is a committed Twain-ophile who has read and reread nearly everything Twain ever wrote. In these pages Rasmussen offers up Twain's trenchant and provocative words on such wide-ranging subjects as fried chicken ("the art cannot be learned north of the line of Mason and Dixon, nor anywhere in Europe"), Hinduism ("It is a good and gentle religion, but inconvenient"), the multiplication table ("that odious and confusing and unvanquishable and unlearnable and shameless invention"), and stealing ("It is better to take what does not belong to you than to let it lie around neglected").

Kent Rasmussen</b> has published two books on Mark Twain: <i>Mark Twain's Book for Bad Boys and Girls</i> and <i>Mark Twain A to Z</i>, which won a special citation by the Reference and Adult Services committee of the American Library Association as one of the best reference books published in 1995.</p></p><h2>The Complete Guide to Stationary Gas Engines</h2><p>The purpose of this book is to provide information on the history, design, function and manufacture of early internal combustion engines of the 19th century. The book covers all the basic systems of these &#39;flywheel&#39; engines. Many of the puzzling components of the gas engine are thoroughly explained to the reader so that a general knowledge of their workings becomes clear. The chapters cover engine components in detail such as, magnetos, hot tube and sparkplug ignition, cooling systems, timing systems and different engine designs. The reader can also find useful collecting tips such as how to evaluate an engine before purchasing it and what a fair market price might be based on an engine&#39;s condition. The book explains how these engines were originally used in industry and on farms and businesses in America and the author shares his extensive research, cataloging over 3600 different engines and their manufacturers, dating from 1885 to 1940.</p><p>Mark J. Meincke lives in Avon, Ohio with his wife Wendy. As an avid and enthusiastic collector of gas engines for 35 years, Meincke has meticulously researched and restored hundreds of engines. In addition to his collection, in his machine shop Meincke repairs and recreates rare engine parts for his own engines and those of gas engine hobbyists all over the world. Meincke wrote this book to share his expertise and love of gas engines with both new and seasoned collectors. Although Meincke believes that &#x201c;we are all only curators of these machines for a brief period in time,&#x201d; it is his hope that many others will join him in the preservation and appreciation of these early innovative engines, for generations to come.</p><h2>Google SketchUp 8 For Dummies</h2><p><b>Go 3D with Google's exciting architectural design software for Mac and Windows</b> <p>Whether you need to learn 3D modeling for business or you're just eager to see what you can create, <i>Google SketchUp</i> and <i>Google SketchUp 8 For Dummies</i> are for you.

With prize specimens like Marx, Lenin, Trotsky, Stalin, and Khrushchev to operate on, Doctor Armour dissects the Comrades with glee and a sharp pen. There are laughs aplenty as Armour, proving that the pun is mightier than the sword, makes capital of Das Kapital, describes the orgies of the Orgburo, and leads his happy fans through revolutions, counterrevolutions, and counter counterrevolutions. For extra fun, he makes a few uninhibited explorations into the communist world of atheism and free love. Although Richard Armour is best known to the public as a humorist, his remarkably varied career has a serious side as well: a PhD from Harvard, Professor of English at Scripps College and Claremont Graduate School in California, with eighteen books to his credit including a number of scholarly works, some 4,000 published poems, and hundreds of articles and reviews in more than eighty magazines in England and America.</p><p></p><h2>Differentiating Instruction with Menus: Social Studies (Grades 3-5)</h2><p><i>Differentiating Instruction With Menus </i>offers teachers everything they need to create a student-centered learning environment based on choice. Addressing the four main subject areas (language arts, math, science, and social studies) and the major concepts taught within these areas, these books provide a number of different types of menus that elementary-aged students can use to select exciting products that they will develop so teachers can assess what has been learned&#x2015;instead of using a traditional worksheet format.<br><br>Each book contains attractive reproducible menus, each based on the levels of Bloom's revised taxonomy, for students to use to guide them in making decisions as to which products they will develop after studying a major concept or unit. Using creative and challenging choices found in Tic-Tac-Toe Menus, List Menus, 2-5-8 Menus, Baseball Menus, and Game Show Menus, students will look forward to sharing their newfound knowledge throughout the year. Also included are specific guidelines for products, rubrics for assessing student products, and teacher introduction pages for each menu.<br><br>This book includes menus that teach students about ancient history, American history, government, U.S. documents, people in history, and geography.</p><p>These books are full of product based menus meant to accompany various units of study, however, the higher level product activities found on the menus can be selected and used whole group, or provided as options after a compacting preassessment. Think of these books as a jumping off point to meet whatever needs you may have! &nbsp;I absolutely love the flexibility of menus!&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I wrote this book with the hope that it would make menus more accessible to everyone; create a "household name," if you will. Menus are so flexible and useful; once they are implemented, teachers begin to look for other uses for them. &nbsp;It is not that teachers or curriculum writers can not create these menus themselves, but since there just isn't always enough time, these books are designed to be ready to use.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Menus are appropriate for&nbsp;<b>all grade&nbsp;</b>levels and areas of instruction. If you try a menu of your own design, or one from my books and it isn't everything you hoped it would be - please contact me! I would be happy to brainstorm improvements with you. Drop me an e-mail and we will figure it out!Laurie Westphal experienced academic concepts in the same manner as other students--through the use of chapter reading and questions, and copying notes. After questioning this practice, she decided to break the mold when she entered the classroom as a teacher. She was given the freedom to develop engaging, product-based lessons and activities, which encouraged choice, the kind of teaching she missed as a student.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>She used this method of teaching science for 14 years, both overseas and in the U.S., as well as presented staff development and worked in gifted education. She currently works as an independent gifted education and science consultant, sharing her message as a staff developer and nationwide speaker on menus and differentiation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She currently resides in Houston, TX and has made it her goal to share her vision for real-world, product-based lessons that help all students become critical thinkers and effective problem solvers.</p><h2>Under Guns of the German Aces</h2><p>Four distinguished German air aces of World War I, and their battles with Allied airmen are profiled in this book. Max Immelmann, the &#34;Eagle of Lille&#34; accounted for 17 British and French aeroplanes, Werner Voss&#39;s victories amounted to 48, thirdly the infamous Herman Goring, who gained 22 victories, and finally Lothar Von Richthofen, younger brother of the Red Baron. All four men received Germany&#39;s highest award for bravery in action, the famed &#34;Blue Max&#34;. In total 124 victories are recorded and analyzed in detail, and there are in-depth personal portraits of the men who were unlucky enough to find themselves under the guns of these deadly German aces.</p><p></p><h2>The Age of American Impressionism: Masterpieces from the Art Institute of Chicago</h2><p><p>The Art Institute of Chicago, although renowned for its holdings of works by the French Impressionists,&nbsp;also houses a wealth of superb examples by American proponents of this distinctive style.

In addition, important paintings and watercolors by notable artists such as Cecilia Beaux, William Merritt Chase, Childe Hassam, George Inness, Mauric Prendergast, and John Twachtman are included, along with handsomely reproduced images by lesser-known artists who worked in the Impressionist vein.</p></p><p><b>Judith A.

Click here to download (PDF, 117KB).</strong></p> <p>This is the time to think boldly about adolescent literacy. So much of what we know about adolescents and their learning has changed in the last decade, and since then both the world of education and the world at large have become very different places. <em>Adolescent Literacy </em>convenes a conversation among today's most important educational thinkers and practitioners to address crucial advances in research on adolescent learning, to assess which of our current practices meets the challenges of the twenty-first century, and to discover transformative ideas and methods that turn the promise of education into instructional practice.</p> In <em>Adolescent Literacy</em> renowned educators Kylene Beers, Bob Probst, and Linda Rief lead twenty-eight of the most important and widely read educators across the country in a conversation about where we are in the teaching of literacy to adolescents and how best to move forward. From researchers to classroom teachers, from long-treasured voices to important new members of the education community, <em>Adolescent Literacy </em>includes the thoughts of central figures in the field today. <em>Adolescent Literacy</em> discusses the most provocative issues of our time, including: <ul> <li>English language learners</li> <li>struggling readers</li> <li>technology in the classroom</li> <li>multimodal literacy</li> <li>compelling writing instruction</li> <li>teaching in a "flat world"</li> <li>young adult literature.</li> </ul> Each of its chapters builds on the previous to create a unified story of adolescent literacy that will help all middle and secondary teachers and administrators envision literacy instruction in exciting new ways. In addition <em>Adolescent Literacy</em>'sassessment rubrics for teachers, administrators, and staff developers make it an ideal resource for schoolwide and districtwide professional development, while its accompanying study guide is perfect for small-group discussions. Now is indeed the time to create a powerful vision of how to teach adolescents.

The mice (first seen as an intriguing row of bright tails on the elegantly spare black title spread) are the colors of the rainbow plus white; they, the white text, and the parts of the elephant (as they really are and as the mice imagine them) are superimposed on a dramatic black ground. The real elephant is skillfully composed with textured and crumpled paper in gentle earth tones; in a sly philosophical twist, the form each mouse imagines is the color of the mouse: e.g., Green Mouse says the trunk is a snake, shown as green. On Sunday, White Mouse (the only female) runs over the entire elephant, getting the others to join her; now, at last, with her help, they all understand the whole. Exquisitely crafted: a simple, gracefully honed text, an appealing story, real but unobtrusive values and levels of meaning, and outstanding illustrations and design--all add up to a perfect book.

Satir skillfully reframed perceptions and attitudes, and installed useful presuppositions about positive intentions, alternative choices and learnings. She did this using physical contact, exaggeration, and humor. She directly challenged limiting beliefs and overgeneralizations, and used a wide range of hypnotic language patterns to help clients see events in new ways.<p></p> The second section is a richly-annotated verbatim transcript of a 73-minute videotaped session with Linda, a woman who started out with great resentment toward her mother, but who ended with a deep appreciation and loving understanding of her mother's behavior and attitudes.<p></p> A follow-up interview with Linda, conducted three years later, shows the permanent impact of the changes Satir had achieved with her. Steve Andreas' insightful commentary reveals the subtlety, precision, and wisdom of Satir's methods, both verbal and nonverbal. Therapists and other professionals who seek positive change in their clients can learn a lot from his book. <p></p> <b>From the Publisher</b><p></p> (Introduction by Steve Andreas) Virginia Satir is almost universally acknowledged as one of the most powerful and effective therapists of the century.

Our descriptions of our own behavior are often biased and myopic, and we all know how to do much more than we can explain to someone else. This was particularly true of Virginia, who was continually moving away from her psychiatric-based training of the 1940s, and intuitively pioneering new ways of helping people learn how to deal with life's inevitable problems. Most therapists' descriptions of their therapy tend to be global and unspecific. Virginia, for instance, would talk about "gaining trust," "making contact," "building positive self-worth," and the importance of the "human connection" and an "I-thou relationship." Although she demonstrated these skills exquisitely, she was much less able to specify exactly how she accomplished them, either verbally or nonverbally. To learn how she actually achieved these things, we have to study her work itself. Although few therapists are willing to demonstrate publicly what they do--they prefer to practice privately--Virginia was a happy exception. Not only did she conduct thousands of public demonstrations during her long career, she also freely allowed videotape recording. Probably as many videotaped hours of Virginia's work exist as of all other prominent therapists combined. Used with a verbatim transcript, a videotape makes it possible to analyze the fine details of verbal communication, the accompanying nonverbal communication which is even richer and more complex, the ongoing interplay between the verbal and nonverbal communication, and the flow and sequence of the session as a whole.

Used with a verbatim transcript, a videotape makes it possible to analyze the fine details of verbal communication, the accompanying nonverbal communication which is even richer and more complex, the ongoing interplay between the verbal and nonverbal communication, and the flow and sequence of the session as a whole. Repeated review brings an ever-deepening understanding of the process of change. </p><p>The heart of this book is a verbatim transcript of a 73-minute videotaped session of Virginia working with a woman, Linda, in a weekend workshop held in 1986 at the peak of Virginia's power and skill, only two years before her death in September 1988. In this particularly moving individual session, Linda moves from great anger at and resentment of her mother to feeling compassion and love for her. A follow-up interview with Linda over three years later verifies the lasting positive impact that this session had on Linda's life and her relationship with her mother. </p><p>This session is particularly interesting for at least two reasons. Virginia was known primarily as a family therapist, and in family sessions she alternately focused her attention on different family members. In contrast, this session focused only on Linda, so it is much easier to follow the patterns and sequence of her work. </p><p>The second reason is that Linda was not an easy client. Although very expressive and willing to share her feelings, she also had what Virginia described during the session as "a highly-developed ability to stand firm on things." Since Virginia had to work very hard to change certain understandings in Linda, we are treated to a particularly rich display of her versatility and persistence. </p><p>Commentary and descriptions have been added to the verbatim transcript to clarify and characterize what Virginia was doing at each point as she patiently leads Linda step by step toward forgiveness. The first chapter describes the important themes of Virginia's work, making it easier to understand their significance as they appear throughout the session. </p><p>Many therapists have the warmth and compassion that Virginia demonstrated so abundantly, yet they are largely ineffective because they don't know what to do. Others have technical communication skills; but without the nonverbal human qualities Virginia emphasized so much, their work is much less effective than it could be. Virginia is a particularly worthy teacher because she possessed warmth, compassion, finely-honed perceptions, and specific skills and techniques. </p><p>To make sure his students had a little humility in using what he taught (something many might say he lacked himself), my old teacher Fritz Perls used to say, "Just because you've got a chisel doesn't make you Michelangelo." On the other hand, how much could Michelangelo have accomplished without any chisels at all? Imagine Michelangelo trying to carve a marble block with only his fingernails to release the vision imprisoned within the stone. Great work needs both the tools of the trade and the vision and humanity to direct those tools. Virginia Satir demonstrated an extraordinary measure of both. If we want to honor her genius, I know of no better way than to study her work carefully and learn how to do what she did so beautifully.</p>(From the Forward by Richard Bandler) In the transcript that Steve Andreas has analyzed here, he has taken to heart not only Virginia's caring attitude toward people, but the specific ways in which she achieves the outcome she seeks. The most powerful thing you can learn from this transcript is that Virginia never wavers from what she sets out to do. And what she sets out to do is what the client asks her to do. She tries everything she can, and everything she does relates directly to the client's desired state. <p>The terminology and the way in which Steve studies Virginia are perhaps different from how most people would, and perhaps similar to the way in which I would approach a study of her. But I think what this book offers the sincere student of Virginia Satir is more than just an attitude. It offers a profound example of how tenacious, persistent, and resourceful Virginia was, and at the same time, how precise and methodical. If Virginia was one of the people you ever envied in your life, or would ever want to emulate, rather than emulating her tonality, style, and jargon, or the kinds of things she said, I think it is time we got serious enough to emulate her skill. And that requires that we sit down and break it into pieces, and find out what this genius was doing, so that we can do the same kind of work with the same kind of tenacity and heart. </p><p>Steve, I think you have done a beautiful job. For those of you about to read this book, read on and learn. The wisdom of Virginia Satir will be worthy of study for centuries to come. I think this book stands as a real tribute to what she did and what she cared about. And although this is different from her own teaching style, as Virginia said, "We are all slow learners, but we are all educable."</p></p><h2>A Rebel Wife in Texas: The Diary and Letters of Elizabeth Scott Neblett, 1852--1864</h2><p><p><i>A Rebel Wife in Texas</i> offers a singular glimpse into nineteenth-century southern culture through the eyes of a captivating and complex woman who, as a product of that culture, both revered and reviled it.</p><br><br><p>Elizabeth Scott Neblett was raised in a slaveholding family in eastern Texas. Despite the frontier conditions, she was very much a southern belle who embraced conventional dictates and aspired to the &#x201c;cult of true womanhood.&#x201d; Neblett entered romantic marriage and motherhood with optimism, but over time her experiences as a wife and mother made her severe and increasingly despondent. When the Civil War ripped away the existing social structure and took her husband away from home, she was pressed to assume many of his responsibilities, including managing the family property and its eleven slaves.

While retaining the useful "factors of soil formation format," it has been extensively revised, incorporating a considerable amount of new research and offering a greater number of topics and examples -- particularly in the chapters "Weathering and Soil Development with Time" and "Topography: Soil Relations with Time in Different Climatic Settings." Greater emphasis is placed on the role of dust in pedogenesis, and new data are included on tropical soil development, global soil-loess relations, neotectonics, and reduction processes. The text discusses field applications such as the use of soils in recognizing climate change, estimating the age of geological deposits, and dealing with environmental problems such as acid rain. New "how-to" appendices on soil descriptions and calculating the profile development index are also included. <em>Soils and Geomorphology</em> is an ideal text for advanced undergraduate and graduate students in courses on pedology, soil science, Quaternary geology, archeology, and sedimentary petrology.<br></p><p>Peter Birkeland is at University of Colorado, Boulder."Greatly revised, better than ever! Much new material. Chapter on Weather and Soil Development with Time was especially helpful. Perhaps the most valuable book on my bookshelf."--Hugh Mills, Tennessee Tech University<br><br>"This third edition greatly expands and updates the second (1984) edition. It is written for soil scientists, geomorphologists, geologists, geographers, and archeologists but would be an excellent text for advanced undergraduate and graduate students in pedology, soil science, Quaternary<br>geology, and sedimentary geology. This book retains, but also expands and updates, the first five chapters from the previous edition that cover soil morphology, classification, weathering, weathering products and soil-forming processes. Chapter six, factors of soil formation, sets the theme for the<br>remaining four chapters, which addresses the relationship among soils and their formation with parent material, time, topography and climate.

Illegal immigrants are swarming over our borders. Our nation and American families are crippled by debt. We remain vulnerable to Islamist terrorist attacks. Judges ignore the Constitution and instead legislate from the bench. Faith and traditional values are under incessant assault from the media, leftist lawyers, and the liberal establishment. The core message of the Declaration of Independence--that everyone has a God-given right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness--is under threat from liberals who deny the right to life (or even the very idea of God-given rights), and who think the answer to every problem is a government program. They think that God, if He exists, might not know best, but liberal-run government certainly does. If you're worried about the direction our country is going, you're in good company. Chuck Norris remembers a better America--an America of faith, freedom, and respect for tradition, history, and human life--and in <i>Black Belt Patriotism</i> he shows what we need to do to reawaken the American dream, reignite the American spirit, and give our children and grandchildren the America they deserve: an America of freedom, opportunity, and faith. In ten practical, down-to-earth chapters, Norris gets back to basics, mining the insights of our founding fathers and applying their wisdom to the problems of today: immigration, the culture wars, the war against global terrorism, national (and personal) debt, even the epidemic of obesity that is killing more Americans than terrorists do. With the optimistic, get your-hands-dirty, can-do spirit that typifies what's best about America, Chuck Norris grapples with the toughest problems facing our country and proves that they're no match for <i>Black Belt Patriotism</i>.</p><i>Black Belt Patriotism</i> is my critique of what is destroying our country, and offers my solutions for rebuilding America and restoring the American dream.

More than any other subject, the female nude connotes `art'. The framed image of a female body, hung on the walls of an art gallery, is an icon of Western culture, a symbol of civilization and accomplishment. But how and why did the female nude acquire this status?<br><em>The Female Nude</em> brings together, in an entirely new way, analysis of the historical tradition of the female nude and discussion of recent feminist art, and by exploring the ways in which acceptable and unacceptable images of the female body are produced and maintained, renews recent debates on high culture and pornography.<br><em>The Female Nude</em> represents the first feminist survey of the most significant subject in Western art. It reveals how the female nude is now both at the centre and at the margins of high culture. At the centre, and within art historical discourse, the female nude is seen as the visual culmination of enlightenment aesthetics; at the edge, it risks losing its repectability and spilling over into the obscene.</p><p><strong>`... this is a book which will be universally welcomed ... clearly written and beautifully paced, it does not avoid the difficult aspects of the theoretical and philosophical underpinning of even the most commonplace utterances on art forms seen as productive of contemplative pleasure and excited arousal.'</strong> - <em>Marcia Pointon, Times Higher Educational Supplement</em></p><h2>German social democracy, 1905-1917;: The development of the great schism, (Harvard historical studies)</h2><p>No political parties of present-day Germany are separated by a wider gulf than the two parties of labor, one democratic and reformist, the other totalitarian and socialist-revolutionary. Social Democrats and Communists today face each other as bitter political enemies across the front lines of the cold war; yet they share a common origin in the Social Democratic Party of Imperial Germany. How did they come to go separate ways? By what process did the old party break apart?

"A frivolous society," Wharton wrote, "can acquire dramatic significance only through what its frivolity destroys."<br><br> Library of America Paperback Classics feature authoritative texts drawn from the acclaimed Library of America series and introduced by today?s most distinguished scholars and writers. Each book features a detailed chronology of the author?s life and career, and essay on the choice of the text, and notes.<br><br> The contents of this Paperback Classic are drawn from <i>Edith Wharton: Novels</i>, volume number 30 in the Library of America series. It is joined in the series by four companion volumes, gathering novellas, short stories, and other writing by Edith Wharton.</p><p>"The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth," warns Ecclesiastes 7:4, and so does the novel by Edith Wharton that takes its title from this call to heed. New York at the turn of the century was a time of opulence and frivolity for those who could afford it. But for those who couldn't and yet wanted desperately to keep up with the whirlwind, like Wharton's charming Lily Bart, it was something else altogether: a gilded cage rather than the Gilded Age. <p> One of Wharton's earliest descriptions of her heroine, in the library of her bachelor friend and sometime suitor Lawrence Selden, indicates that she appears "as though she were a captured dryad subdued to the conventions of the drawing room." Indeed, herein lies Lily's problem. She has, we're told, "been brought up to be ornamental," and yet her spirit is larger than what this ancillary role requires. By today's standards she would be nothing more than a mild rebel, but in the era into which Wharton drops her unmercifully, this tiny spark of character, combined with numerous assaults by vicious society women and bad luck, ultimately renders Lily persona non grata. Her own ambivalence about her position serves to open the door to disaster: several times she is on the verge of "good" marriage and squanders it at the last moment, unwilling to play by the rules of a society that produces, as she calls them, "poor, miserable, marriageable girls.</p><p> Lily's rather violent tumble down the social ladder provides a thumbnail sketch of the general injustices of the upper classes (which, incidentally, Wharton never quite manages to condemn entirely, clearly believing that such life is cruel but without alternative). From her start as a beautiful woman at the height of her powers to her sad finale as a recently fired milliner's assistant addicted to sleeping drugs, Lily Bart is heroic, not least for her final admission of her own role in her downfall. "Once--twice--you gave me the chance to escape from my life and I refused it: refused it because I was a coward," she tells Selden as the book draws to a close. All manner of hideous socialite beasts--some of whose treatment by Wharton, such as the token social-climbing Jew, Simon Rosedale, date the book unfortunately--wander through the novel while Lily plummets. As her tale winds down to nothing more than the remnants of social grace and cold hard cash, it's hard not to agree with Lily's own assessment of herself: "I have tried hard--but life is difficult, and I am a very useless person. I can hardly be said to have an independent existence. I was just a screw or a cog in the great machine I called life, and when I dropped out of it I found I was of no use anywhere else." Nevertheless, it's even harder not to believe that she deserved better, which is why <i>The House of Mirth</i> remains so timely and so vital in spite of its crushing end and its unflattering portrait of what life offers up. <i>--Melanie Rehak</i></p>10 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>The Supreme Court in American Politics</h2><p>The Supreme Court&#39;s involvement in many hot political and personal conflicts makes crucial an understanding of its internal workings and evolution. This book gives students a firm historical and institutional base upon which to evaluate contemporary Supreme Court decisions and the impact of those decisions on the lives of ordinary citizens.</p><p>ISSAC UNAH is Associate Professor of Political Science, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, USA.<p>"Isaac Unah's book is a very welcome and exciting addition to undergraduate teaching on the Supreme Court. The book is exceptionally well written and engaging; it is rich in historical detail about key events and people that shaped this important institution. Examples cover the early days of the nation, through its development, and into modern and recent times. The book effectively introduces the most important questions and theories about the Supreme Court to students in a way that gives them a comprehensive view of political science research on the Court. I am looking forward to using this book in my classes." - Valerie Hoekstra, Associate Professor of Political Science, Arizona State University</p> <p>"In The Supreme Court in American Politics, Unah provides an incredibly comprehensive portrait of the Court as a political institution, carefully tracking and exploring the appointment process, decision making from certiorari review to oral argument to merits determination, and finally the impact of the Court s decisions. Carefully grounded in the existing literature, this book will serve graduate and undergraduate students of the Supreme Court well by laying a solid and sophisticated groundwork for their understanding of this important institution." - Stefanie A. Lindquist, Thomas W. Gregory Professor of Law, The University of Texas at Austin</p> <p>"Isaac Unah s The Supreme Court in American Politics successfully synthesizes legal, historical, and behavioral scholarship to provide an insightful yet accessible book on the U.S. Supreme Court. Unah s self-described evolutionary approach carefully chronicles major changes in the Court s process, personnel, agenda, and decisions through U.S. history while also utilizing political science research to explain the causes of those changes, distinguishing this work from other books on the Supreme Court. Throughout the chapters on different aspects of the Court, the author asks the types of questions that students, casual court observers, and scholars will find interesting and important, and he provides historical examples, empirical evidence, and social science theory to help the reader answer those questions.This is an excellent compact resource for anyone interested in multiple approaches to understanding the role ofthe U.S. Supreme Court in the American political system." - J.

There is little enough out there that offers us, gays and lesbians, a spiritual life. It is in itself a good introduction to Buddhism, though lacks a lesbian perspective. Still if you are going to read anything as a gay man on Buddhism, this has to be it. - From review.</p><p></p><h2>Civic Ritual in Renaissance Venice</h2><p><p>Venice's reputation for political stability and a strong, balanced republican government holds a prominent place in European political theory. Edward Muir traces the origins and development of this reputation, paying particular attention to the sixteenth century, when civic ritual in Venice reached its peak. He shows how the ritualization of society and politics was an important reason for Venice's stability. Influenced in part by cultural anthropology, he establishes and applies to Venice a new methodology for the historical study of civic ritual.</p></p><p></p><h2>Macroeconomics, 2nd Edition</h2><p>When looking to bridge the gap between global economic events and their own daily lives, Americans have increasingly turned to Paul Krugman.

By the early 1800s, far higher proportions of women were teaching in the Northeast than in the South, and this regional difference was reproduced as settlers moved West before the Civil War. What explains the creation of these divergent regional arrangements in the East, their recreation in the West, and their eventual disappearance by the next century?<br><br>In <i>Women's Work</i> the authors blend newly available quantitative evidence with historical narrative to show that distinctive regional school structures and related cultural patterns account for the initial regional difference, while a growing recognition that women could handle the work after they temporarily replaced men during the Civil War helps explain this widespread shift to female teachers later in the century. Yet despite this shift, a significant gender gap in pay and positions remained. This book offers an original and thought-provoking account of a remarkable historical transition.</p><p><b>Joel Perlmann</b> is a senior scholar at the Jerome Levy Economics Institute of Bard College and Levy Institute Research Professor at the College.

Mark Larrimore provides a panoramic history of this remarkable book, traversing centuries and traditions to examine how Job's trials and his challenge to God have been used and understood in diverse contexts, from commentary and liturgy to philosophy and art.</p><br><p> Larrimore traces Job's obscure origins and his reception and use in the Midrash, burial liturgies, and folklore, and by figures such as Gregory the Great, Maimonides, John Calvin, Immanuel Kant, William Blake, Margarete Susman, and Elie Wiesel. He chronicles the many ways the Book of Job's interpreters have linked it to other biblical texts; to legends, allegory, and negative and positive theologies; as well as to their own individual and collective experiences. Larrimore revives old questions and provides illuminating new contexts for contemporary ones. Was Job a Jew or a gentile? Was his story history or fable? What is meant by the "patience of Job," and does Job exhibit it? Why does God speak yet not engage Job's questions?</p><br><p> Offering rare insights into this iconic and enduring book, Larrimore reveals how Job has come to be viewed as the Bible's answer to the problem of evil and the perennial question of why a God who supposedly loves justice permits bad things to happen to good people.</p></p><p><p>"As eloquent and engaging as it is carefully researched and richly insightful, Larrimore's biography of the Book of Job delves deeply into the staying power of this wonderfully disturbing story.

There is no more economical way of getting a sophisticated sense of the theological issues at stake in the Book of Job than in reading Larrimore's book."<b>--Edward L. Greenstein, Bar-Ilan University</b></p><p>"In the brief compass of this well-researched, well-written, and well-illustrated book, Mark Larrimore has brilliantly captured the most salient aspects of the rich afterlife of the Book of Job, including the interpretations evident in translations and theological and philosophical writings, as well as in the literary, visual, and performing arts.

This is a definitive guide to human efforts to recover, understand and represent the past, bringing together different historical traditions and their social, economic, political and cultural contexts. Daniel Woolf offers clear definitions of different genres and forms of history and addresses key themes such as the interactions between West and East, the conflict of oral, pictographic, and written accounts of the past and the place of history in society and in politics. Numerous textual extracts and illustrations in every chapter capture the historical cultures of past civilizations and demonstrate the different forms that historical consciousness has taken around the world.

In order to formulate their own personal worldviews, students need to know how and where to begin, what choices they have, and why anyone would adopt one basic belief over another.<br> <em>Philosophical Dilemmas: A Pro and Con Introduction to the Major Questions,</em> Third Edition, outlines the principal positions that philosophers have articulated through the ages, helping students to understand what philosophers do and how they do it. Comprehensive and lucidly written, it features sixty-four brief essays--arranged in sets of two or three--on thirty-one important questions. The essays are arguments that author Phil Washburn has either created or recreated, rather than excerpts from the work of philosophers. With affirmative and negative responses, each set answers one of the standard philosophical questions, such as "Does God exist?" or "Is morality relative?" Each essay takes a definite stand and promotes it vigorously, creating a sharp contrast between the two positions and giving each abstract theory a more personal and believable "voice." While the essays often employ traditional arguments of great philosophers, they present the ideas in contemporary language with vivid examples. The accessible style and conflicting answers encourage students to examine the different positions and to think carefully about which essay makes the stronger case. In contrast with other textbooks, which often present a series of excerpts and theories without attempting to coordinate them into a larger picture, <em>Philosophical Dilemmas</em> teaches students about the process of thinking philosophically and encourages them to construct their own coherent worldviews. This third edition features two new sections (four new essays) on the meaning of life and on personal identity, expanded and updated annotated bibliographies, and an appendix, "How to Write an Essay."<br> <em>Philosophical Dilemmas,</em> Third Edition, offers numerous pedagogical features including an introduction to each issue, a list of historical parallels, key terms, chapter summaries, a glossary, and critical study questions following each essay. Brief sections throughout the book describe numerous critical thinking techniques demonstrated by the essays. An annotated bibliography of historical examples for each issue and useful lists of contemporary sources further enhance the text's utility. An <strong>Instructor's Manual,</strong> including chapter summaries, writing assignments, and test questions, is available on CD.</p><p>Phil Washburn is a Master Teacher in the General Studies Program at the School of Continuing and Professional Studies at N.Y.U. ."This is the first text I've seen for Intro. to Philosophy that really attempts to connect with students' lives."--Stuart Dalton, University of Hartford<br><br>"A really interesting and fun book to read.

He came to know it intimately and was welcomed by its residents, who are Italian, Mexican, Puerto Rican, and Negro. Suttles contends that the residents of a slum neighborhood have a set of standards for behavior that take precedence over the more widely held "moral standards" of "straight" society. These standards arise out of the specific experience of each locality, are peculiar to it, and largely determine how the neighborhood people act. One of the tasks of urban sociology, according to Suttles, is to explore why and how slum communities provide their inhabitants with these local norms. <i>The Social Order of the Slum</i> is the record of such an exploration, and it defines theoretical principles and concepts that will aid in subsequent research.</p></p><p>Gerald D.

Part 1 begins with the fall of the &#34;notables&#34; and the victory of the republicans. Then follows a picture of the economy and society of late nineteenth-century France, and an examination of spiritual and cultural development under the increasing threat from nationalist and socialist forces. The moderates&#39; brief ascendancy at the end of the century followed by the extreme sentiments unleashed at the time of the Dreyfus affair, brings the story in Part 2 to a more passionately political period, when the republic finallynbecame established as a bulwark of bourgeois prosperity, witnessing the rise of the banks and big business, and the dangerous revival of colonial expansion.</p><p>Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>Anatomy &amp; Physiology Coloring Workbook: A Complete Study Guide</h2><p>Written by Elaine Marieb, this study guide can be used independently or in conjunction with any A&amp;P book.

Grattan-Guinness has written the first comprehensive history of the mathematical background, content, and impact of the mathematical logic and philosophy of mathematics that Russell developed with A. N. Whitehead in their Principia mathematica (1910-1913). This definitive history of a critical period in mathematics includes detailed accounts of the two principal influences upon Russell around 1900: the set theory of Cantor and the mathematical logic of Peano and his followers. Substantial surveys are provided of many related topics and figures of the late nineteenth century: the foundations of mathematical analysis under Weierstrass; the creation of algebraic logic by De Morgan, Boole, Peirce, Schr�der, and Jevons; the contributions of Dedekind and Frege; the phenomenology of Husserl; and the proof theory of Hilbert. The many-sided story of the reception is recorded up to 1940, including the rise of logic in Poland and the impact on Vienna Circle philosophers Carnap and G�del. A strong American theme runs though the story, beginning with the mathematician E. H. Moore and the philosopher Josiah Royce, and stretching through the emergence of Church and Quine, and the 1930s immigration of Carnap and G�deI. Grattan-Guinness draws on around fifty manuscript collections, including the Russell Archives, as well as many original reviews. The bibliography comprises around 1,900 items, bringing to light a wealth of primary materials. Written for mathematicians, logicians, historians, and philosophers-especially those interested in the historical interaction between these disciplines-this authoritative accou</p><p><p>"I know of no comparably comprehensive treatment of the history of this important period in modern logic. There is a large body of historical literature that is in need of just the kind of synthesis and masterly overview that this work provides.

This spectacular book offers the most authoritative account of the British monarchy ever published for the general reader. With over 400 illustrations--a third of them in color--it traces the crown's full history from Anglo-Saxon times to the present.<br> The authors begin with the rise of recognizable kingdoms in Scotland, Wales, and England in the fifth century and conclude with a discussion of the crown's constitutional role, which emerged in Queen Victoria's reign, and how this has affected the monarchy of today. Along the way, we see how key traditions evolved: the right of succession, coronations and marriages, oaths of loyalty and military service, the granting of lands and titles, and the propagation of a powerful image of royalty.<br> Supporting the text and illustrations are sidebars on each of the monarchs and on key general themes, color maps, an illustrated section on royal residences and tombs, a consolidated list of monarchs, genealogies, annotated lists of further reading, and a full index with personal dates.</p><p>John Cannon is Emeritus Professor of History at the University of Newcastle.

He is a visiting prefessor of history at Mount Holyoke College.1 WAR GAME <br><br>JANUARY 2, 1941: THE KREMLIN The end of 1940 was grim. Two armies, one clad in gray, the other in khaki, were destroying the Old World. They had thrown themselves at Europe abruptly and ferociously, like ants attacking a cake left on a garden table. And like ants, they arrived in geometrically impeccable columns, never questioning their right to devour the trophy.<br> The ants were of two different species. The grays took orders from the German F�hrer, Adolf Hitler; the khakis closed ranks around the Soviet leader, or vozhd, Joseph Stalin. Having been dismissed by cultured European politicians, cartoonists, and sketch writers as pests that could be stamped out by the civilized world in a flash, the ants had proved their worth by 1940.<br> France crumbled under the wheels of German tanks in less than three weeks. The British force on the continent, expected to save the day, was decimated at Dunkirk. As headlines shouted about the impending demise of these two great powers, pillars of the West since the days of the Crusades, smaller European nations such as Belgium, Holland, Denmark, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Norway wriggled under German occupation, their cries unheard by the panicking world. At the other end of the continent, the Red Army grabbed Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia and tore away chunks of Poland, Finland, and Romania.<br> In both the west and the east, killings were performed speedily and expertly: troops swept through the ancient cities, blind to decorum, and the punitive squads followed immediately to scavenge, to cleanse, to kill. Hitler&#x2019;s men looked for Jews and Communists; Stalin&#x2019;s went for the exploiting classes.&#x201d; The proud and elaborate European order, which had taken centuries to create, was smashed in less than a year, because the two armies acted in accord. Hitler let Stalin do what he wanted to on the fringes of Europe, and Stalin turned a blind eye to the plight of the West and even reined in his fifth column abroad, the fanatically anti-Nazi Comintern. But this was not a partnership of equals Hitler snatched the best pieces, and Stalin collected the crumbs. Kaunas was a poor match for Paris, the port of Riga didn&#x2019;t fare nearly as well as that of Rotterdam, and Romanian Cabernet hardly deserved the name when compared to the French varieties.<br> At the end of 1940 a weird lull fell over Europe. The two armies had reached an impasse. Germany&#x2019;s hunger could not be sated by the annexation of the few lesser countries, like Yugoslavia and Greece, that were still stubbornly maintaining their sovereignty. The Germans had to launch a spectacular conquest to justify their roll across Europe; that was what all other empires had done at the peak of their might, and that was what Adolf Hitler had promised the German people.<br> They had few options. One was to invade Britain, another the Middle East; yet another was to strike at the Soviet Union. At the end of 1940 nobody knew which path Hitler would choose.<br> Virtually every person in the Soviet Union had heard about Mein Kampf, Hitler&#x2019;s manifesto, published years before and now distributed to German newlyweds as a state gift. In the book Hitler promised the Germans virtually unlimited living space, lebensraum, on the immense plains between the Danube and the Urals, which now belonged to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, formerly the Russian Empire. Since August 1939 the two countries had been allies, but few Soviets doubted that the deal would be short-lived. They also knew that almost every prominent general in the USSR had been shot during the Great Purge, and the talent and vigor of the men who replaced them had yet to be tested.<br> No matter how much the newspapers bragged about the prosperity of the Communist motherland, people knew that just ten years before, few households had had electricity and people had been signing papers with an X because they couldn&#x2019;t read or write. The workers building power plants, factories, and dams still lived in wooden shacks and muddy holes. In 1932 the government ordered so much grain from Ukraine, with its unsurpassed black earth, that its people suffered a fierce famine. Meanwhile, Germany was a nation of science, efficiency, and advancement.<br> None of this bode well for the nations that had been forcibly herded into the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics over the course of the past twenty-three years. The Red Army, whose soldiers were drafted from urbane Leningrad and arrogant Moscow, demure Byelorussia and warlike Chechnya, Islamic Uzbekistan and Buddhist Buryatia, froze in suspense, anticipating the vozhd&#x2019;s instructions. But as yet no order had come its way.<br>In the fall of 1940 the Soviet people discovered thatt their woods were studded with an amazing number of mushrooms. Highly prized as a delicacy by both rich and poor, mushrooms rarely survived thhhhhe month of September, since they were enthusiastically picked and then pickled, boiled, fried, dried, and saut�ed. However, in 1940 the mushrooms were so plentiful that no matter how many were gathered, many more sprang forth not just the uninspiring yellow chanterelles and the barely edible scarlet russulas, but also the czar of the forest, the delicious and beautiful King Boletus.<br> In a country devastated by economic barbarism and political ineptitude, such a surprising harvest should have been a welcome supplement to a meager diet. It wasn&#x2019;t. Every adult in that superstitious land knew that the unusual abundance of mushrooms meant just one thing: war.<br>In the early evening of January 2, 1941, the generals were summoned to the Kremlin.<br> The order came without warning. The generals were important, and so was their mission in Moscow they were attending an annual conference yet nobody was sure whether the heir of Lenin,&#x201d; the genius of all times and peoples,&#x201d; Iosif Vissarionovich Stalin, would deign to see them.<br> Regardless of the awe the leader inspired in their hearts, the generals knew that he must have been alarmed by what was happening in the west of the country. The strongest army in the world, Hitler&#x2019;s Wehrmacht, rustled and coiled along the border like a gigantic serpent, and it was hard to believe that its intentions were peaceful.<br> The very fact that they had been summoned to the conference indicated that the vozhd was concerned about the state of the army. Conferences of military leaders were held annually, but this assembly was extraordinary. Usually the gatherings were attended by district commanders, their commissars, and chiefs of staff, but this time they were joined by a number of army, corps, and even division leaders, and the meeting was to be followed by a comprehensive strategic game.<br> The generals were uneasy. The most recent execution of military leaders had occurred less than two years before. All of the participants in the conference had benefited from the carnage, as the murders had created lucrative vacancies. However, they could not be sure that the butchery would not resume, this time destroying them as it had destroyed their predecessors.<br> Also, they were confused. Throughout the 1930s they had been taught that Nazism was a belligerent and therefore dangerous ideology. Now, however, their country was bound to Nazi Germany by a pact and also by the joint conquest of Eastern Europe.<br> Throughout the conference week, five reports and fifty presentations were made. One report definitely stood out: that supplied by the commander of the Kiev Military District, Army General Georgy Zhukov, on The Nature of Modern Offensive Operation.&#x201d; Zhukov thought big. In his view, to win a war, an army group had to use at least eighty-five rifle divisions, four mechanized corps, two cavalry corps, and thirty air force divisions. In all, Zhukov suggested, a strike would involve about 1.5 million men, 8,000 aircraft, and 5,000 tanks.<br> Nobody had ever fought a war like that. Whether the generals agreed with Zhukov or not and some found his presentation presumptuous he inspired respect. The man was remarkably vigorous, ambitious, and blunt, qualities all but lost to the army in the recent purge. He looked like he had stepped in from another, happier age, when ingenuity and risk-taking were still the marks of the military man.<br> Zhukov was not the only star of the conference. The commander of the Western Military District, Colonel General Dmitry Pavlov, also delivered a rousing report. Pavlov compared tank operations of World War I to those currently unfolding in Europe. The differences were staggering. During the Battle of the Somme, Pavlov said, tanks had advanced two and a half miles in three hours, and that had been trumpeted as a major success. In May and June 1940, however, the German panzers had crushed all of France in seventeen days. Pavlov sounded motivated and keen, and his presentation was well received. In a way, his report complemented Zhukov&#x2019;s, advocating aggressive use of modern weaponry, but after Pavlov spoke the two generals began to look at each other apprehensively, as their rivalry became clear.<br> On New Year&#x2019;s Eve the junior corps and division commanders were sent back home. Senior generals started preparing for the strategic game, which would pit the Reds&#x201d; against the Blues&#x201d; or the Soviets against the Germans. Unexpectedly, before they began, the generals were told that Stalin required their presence.<br>By 1941 the Kremlin was four and a half centuries old. The Italian architects invited to build it must have felt overwhelmed by the task. For starters, the grand prince of Moscow, Ivan III, needed a castle that could withstand any deadly attack, and Muscovite Russia was endowed with unfortunate strategic terrain: it was remarkably flat, with no significant natural obstacles to deter an enemy&#x2019;s onslaught. It was also landlocked by three assertive powers, Sweden, Poland, and the Ottoman Empire. The Ottomans&#x2019; vassals, the Crimean Tatars, looted Russia every spring, so they knew their way to Moscow well; they had recently pillaged and burned the Russian capital. So, among other things, the Kremlin had to be fireproof.<br> Ivan wanted the new castle to inspire artistic respect too. After the collapse of Byzantium, he had married its heiress, Zo� Palaiologos, and he regarded himself as a successor to the glamorous rulers of Constantinople. In other words, the fortress had to look like a palace. There had never been a shortage of land in Russia, so the prince designated a huge chunk of it for this project, which made the architects&#x2019; task even more challenging.<br> After their initial frustration, the Italians performed valiantly. The new fortress was virtually impenetrable. Its walls were thirty feet high and ran for almost a mile and a half, forming a firm ring atop a hill. That made the Kremlin one of the largest structures in Europe. It was among the gloomiest, too. The red brick with which it was built looked dull even on a sunny day, and its towers were extremely tall and loomed menacingly over the city. Its roofs were shaped like nomadic tents, giving the aura of a military camp. For security reasons the castle was built as a huge triangle, so that the sentries on its towers would have a good view of the walls, but its shape was uncompromisingly sharp. On maps the Kremlin looked like a pointed tooth biting into Moscow&#x2019;s flesh.<br> Ironically, given the monolithic nature of the word kremlin today, every major Russian city used to have such a structure. A kremlin the word means citadel&#x201d; in Russian crowned a hill on a riverbank, and each time nomads attacked from the steppes or a rival prince from the woods, the townsfolk sought shelter behind its walls. There they could count on two things, water and prayer, for every kremlin had a church and a well. As for other essentials, like food and cover, these were reserved for the prince and his army.<br> Gradually kremlins became extinct. The Kremlin devoured them.<br> The rulers of Moscow crushed their opponents and destroyed their castles. Peter the Great, the illustrious westernizer, wanted every Russian city to look like Amsterdam, so kremlins had to be torn down to provide the space needed for baroque chapels and neoclassical mansions. Two centuries after Peter, the Bolsheviks launched their own orgy of reconstruction when revolution delivered Russia into their hands. Kremlins gave way to factories, streetcars, and Marxist statues. But the Moscow kremlin was spared: it became the seat of a government that was afraid of its own people and therefore used the Kremlin&#x2019;s protective walls and watchtowers to powerful effect.<br> Few at the time of the revolution knew that Lenin was more coward than hero. Politically courageous, he simply could not handle physical danger. As soon as the civil war started, he fled the front in Petrograd (as St. Petersburg was then called). A hastily commandeered train took him and his accomplices to Moscow, where cars rushed them to the Kremlin. Lenin didn&#x2019;t like what he saw. The walls were indeed high and thick, but the structure was populated by a coterie of palace servants, priests, monks, and nuns. Lenin firmly ordered them out. He also called for the destruction of the monasteries and Romanov monuments on the grounds and gleefully participated in the demolition himself.<br> Soon the citadel was spacious and quiet. The only intruding sound was the cawing of crows. In 1918, Russians were dying of starvation and there was not much for the crows to scavenge in the garbage bins of Moscow. But food could always be found in the Kremlin. Scanning the citadel for leftovers, hundreds of birds assembled on its spires. The guards started shooting them, but the noise upset Lenin even more than the crows&#x2019; noise, and the hunt was called off.<br> Uninterested in luxuries that he could easily afford, Lenin lived in a tiny apartment with his wife and sister. His tastes were spartan, and the apartment looked like a ward in an orphanage: tidy, gray, minimalist, with narrow and bumpy iron beds, crippled tables, and shabby chairs. Lenin didn&#x2019;t spend much time there anyway, preferring his study, which was conveniently located just across the hallway. That was where he did all his writing and worked for the survival of his new utopian state. At night the Kremlin felt particularly eerie. When the crows were asleep and few people and cars were around, the citadel was completely silent. The steps of a bodyguard pacing the cobblestone yard produced an alarming echo. The engine of an automobile roared like a highland brook. The Kremlin&#x2019;s palaces were abandoned, its churches locked, its past discarded. With its svelte white bell towers resembling lilies and its golden church domes like thistle globes, the citadel bore the look of a petrified garden.<br> In the days of the czars, every Muscovite could see the ruler. All anyone had to do was go to the Kremlin on a big church holiday the czar would be there, spectacular in his golden robes studded with jewels, possibly even distributing candies and linen scarves to the faithful.<br> By the 1940s, though, very few people had access to the Kremlin. Its image was printed on countless posters, stamps, and postcards, but for most people the place was unreal, much like the mysterious demigod who now inhabited it.<br>The generals walked into Stalin&#x2019;s office at 7:30 p.m. Even the few who had seen the vozhd in person couldn&#x2019;t take their eyes off the man. From a distance say, in a convention hall Stalin looked unimposing: a short, stooping, thickset, visibly aged man. But in a smaller space he was an overwhelming presence. The first thing people noticed was his bright light- brown eyes, which were nearly yellow: weirdly intense, discomforting, almost animalistic in their quiet alertness. All his other features his low brow, thick hair, mustache, pockmarks seemed to fade away in the enigmatic glow of his eyes.<br> The voz...</p><h2>An Analysis of Christopher R. Browning&#39;s Ordinary Men: Reserve Police Battalion 101 and the Final Solution in Poland (The Macat Library)</h2><p><p>Of all the controversies facing historians today, few are more divisive or more important than the question of how the Holocaust was possible. What led thousands of Germans &#x2013; many of them middle-aged reservists with, apparently, little Nazi zeal &#x2013; to willingly commit acts of genocide? Was it ideology? Was there something rotten in the German soul? Or was it &#x2013; as Christopher Browning argues in this highly influential book &#x2013; more a matter of conformity, a response to intolerable social and psychological pressure?</p> <p><em>Ordinary Men</em> is a microhistory, the detailed study of a single unit in the Nazi killing machine. Browning evaluates a wide range of evidence to seek to explain the actions of the "ordinary men" who made up reserve Police Battalion 101, taking advantage of the wide range of resources prepared in the early 1960s for a proposed war crimes trial. He concludes that his subjects were not "evil;" rather, their actions are best explained by a desire to be part of a team, not to shirk responsibility that would otherwise fall on the shoulders of comrades, and a willingness to obey authority. </p> <p>Browning's ability to explore the strengths and weaknesses of arguments &#x2013; both the survivors' and other historians' &#x2013; is what sets his work apart from other studies that have attempted to get to the root of the motivations for the Holocaust, and it is also what marks <em>Ordinary Men</em> as one of the most important works of its generation.</p></p><p><p><strong>Dr James Chappel</strong> completed his PhD in Modern History at Columbia University and is currently teaching at Duke University.

Features Internet Law boxes throughout the text detailing 50 new e-commerce and Internet laws. Previous edition not cited. DLC: Business Law--United States.</p><p>To The Students <p> Each semester, as I stand up in front of a new group of business majors in my business law class I am struck by the thought that, cases and statutes aside, I know two very important things that they have yet to learn. The first is that I draw as much from them as they do from me. Their youth, enthusiasm, questions, and even the doubts a few of them hold about the relevance of law to their futures, fuel my teaching. They don't know that every time they open their minds to look at a point from a new perspective or critically question something they have taken for granted, I get a wonderful reward for the work that I do. </p><p> The other thing I know is that both teaching and learning the law are all about stories. The stories I tell provide the framework on which students will hang everything they learn about the law in my class. It is my hope that long after the facts about the specific language of the statutes have faded, they will retain that framework. Several years from now, "unintentional torts" may draw only a glimmer of recognition with business managers who learn about them as students in my class this year. However, they will likely recall the story of the man who sued Pepsi as a result of impotence caused by a vending machine. The story sticks and gives students the hook on which to hang the concepts. </p><p> I remind myself of these two facts every time I sit down to work on writing and revising Business Law, as well. My goal is to present the law in a way that will spur students to ask questions, to go beyond rote memorization. Business law is an evolving outgrowth of its environment, and that environment keeps changing. In addition to the social, ethical, and international contexts I have incorporated in previous editions of Business Law, this edition adds coverage and emphasis on the Internet and entrepreneurship as two vital catalysts to the law and a key part of its environment. </p><p> It is my wish that my commitment to these goals shines through in this labor of love, and I hope you have as much pleasure in using it as I have had in creating it for you.</p><p>Henry Cheeseman</p><p>This new edition of Cheeseman's <i>Business Law</i> recognizes the revolution that the Internet and electronic commerce has brought to business and society throughout the United State and the world. The courts have interpreted and adapted existing laws to apply to e-commerce, while state legislatures and Congress have enacted new statues to regulate the digital economy.</p> <p>The fourth edition of Cheesman's <i>Business Law</i> incorporates e-commerce and Internet law throughout the book.

The demands and opportunities for interpreting these data are expanding more than ever. Biotechnology, pharmacology, and medicine will be particularly affected by the new results and the increased understanding of life at the molecular level. Bioinformatics is the development and application of computer methods for analysis, interpretation, and prediction, as well as for the design of experiments. It has emerged as a strategic frontier between biology and computer science.<br> <br> Machine learning approaches (e.g., neural networks, hidden Markov models, and belief networks) are ideally suited for areas where there is a lot of data but little theory&#x2014;and this is exactly the situation in molecular biology. As with its predecessor, statistical model fitting, the goal in machine learning is to extract useful information from a body of data by building good probabilistic models. The particular twist behind machine learning, however, is to automate the process as much as possible.<br> <br> In this book, Pierre Baldi and S�ren Brunak present the key machine learning approaches and apply them to the computational problems encountered in the analysis of biological data. The book is aimed at two types of researchers and students. First are the biologists and biochemists who need to understand new data-driven algorithms, such as neural networks and hidden Markov models, in the context of biological sequences and their molecular structure and function. Second are those with a primary background in physics, mathematics, statistics, or computer science who need to know more about specific applications in molecular biology.</p><p>An unprecedented wealth of data is being generated by genome sequencing projects and other experimental efforts to determine the structure and function of biological molecules.

It traces the attempts of workers to take control of their working lives from the February Revolution through to June 1918, when the Bolsheviks nationalised industry. Although not primarily concerned with the political developments of the Revolution, the book demonstrates that the sphere of industrial production was a crucial arena of political as well as economic conflict. Having discussed the structure and composition of the factory workforce in Petrograd prior to 1917 and the wages and conditions of workers under the old regime, Dr Smith shows how workers saw the overthrow of the autocracy as a signal to democratise factory life and to improve their lot. After examining the creation and activities of the factory committees, he analyses the relationship of different groups of workers to the new labour movement, and assesses the extent to which it functioned democratically.</p><p>This book explores the impact of the 1917 Revolution on factory life in the Russian capital.

Malcolm Wells has a fundamentally different way of looking at the design and building process, and his iconoclastic perspective has never been more apparent.<br>Yet the message of The Earth-Sheltered House has struck many of its avid enthusiasts as pure common sense. Animals of all kinds (including most early humans, and even millions of people today) know that the best way to stay warm in the winter and cool in the summer is to insulate the living space with earth.</p><p>The striking common sense of the author's perspective on design and the building process is based on millennia of use of earth-sheltered homes by animals and humans, using the earth to warm in winter and cool in summer. A cartoon on the book jacket summarizes Wells's perspective. One panel is called "20th Century," and has four steps of traditional building: love nature, kill it, build building, plant grass. The second panel, called "21st Century," says: love nature, leave it alone, find ruined land, build underground, restore natural habitat.<p> Wells's remarkable and imaginative architectural drawings, sketches, and landscaping and structural design plans are surrounded by his handwritten commentary about Earth-friendly building and design, cryptic remarks and humorous asides that make this book a pleasure to browse or read cover to cover. He offers a breathtaking assortment of some of the most creative and unusual home and building designs ever assembled in one book; site-appropriate structures for both urban and rural settings; and delightfully imaginative, dramatic, simple, and highly complex buildings for all purposes. Some are fully underground structures, some partially earth-sheltered, but all make the best use of light sources, designed to benefit from the sun and seasonal changes, and to protect or restore the natural habitat around and above them. </p><p> Wells's designs seem almost fanciful, but are indeed based on practical considerations and currently usable techniques and materials, helping open up a whole new concept of building based on one of the oldest known: caves and burrows. These are "caves and burrows" of soaring imagination and creative, 21st century brilliance. <i>--Mark A.

This book fills that gap by examining every aspect of their working lives, from their reasons for signing on a slaving vessel, to their experiences in the Caribbean and the American South after their human cargoes had been sold. It explores how they interacted with men and women of African origin at their ports of call, from the Africans they traded with, to the free black seamen who were their crewmates, to the slaves and ex-slaves they mingled with in the port cities of the Americas. Most importantly, it questions their interactions with the captive Africans they were transporting during the dread middle passage, arguing that their work encompassed the commoditisation of these people ready for sale.</p><p>An examination of the working lives of the approximately 350,000 men who labored aboard British and North American slave ships. Marrying slave trade studies to maritime history, it questions how sailors&#39; work in this most abhorrent of trades fits with their posited image as a radical, egalitarian group.Emma Christopher is a Postdoctoral Fellow at the School of Historical Studies, Monash University.

She is the author of <i>Make What You Say Pay!, 365 Sales Tips for Winning Busines</i>s, and <i>Presentation Jazz!</i> She lives with her family in New York City.<br></p>"This second edition of the author's 2004 book <i>Metaphorically Selling</i> features an appendix of 25 new stories&#x2014;38 pages&#x2014;that illustrates how salespeople can effectively use metaphors. <p></p> <p>Drawing on the author's personal experiences, this book focuses on effective business communication, particularly when selling products or attempting to secure corporate accounts. Metaphors, Miller writes, can give mundane explanations a shot of adrenaline and help make abstract ideas comprehensible. However, when overused or misapplied, they often fall on deaf ears. In the first section, Miller explains what a metaphor is and when to use it; in others, she describes how to determine the factors that make metaphors relevant and how to use them for impact. Another section focuses on how to acquire a "metaphor inventory." Miller's succinct summaries and exercises reinforce and test the reader's understanding of the material covered; at times, the format is reminiscent of 1980s self-help books. She effectively uses an abundance of examples throughout. For instance, when she discusses left-brain/right-brain theory, she portrays analytical thought processes as a character called Joe, and visual/intuitive processes as Robin, and uses them to clarify her points. In one chapter, she explains how to take abstractions and relate them to things known, a comparative technique often used to prevent listeners from falling asleep in lecture halls ("That savings is the equivalent of what it would take to build a shopping center for you in the Caribbean.").

The essays in <i>Bringing It All Back Home</i> bring a sense of history, depth, and contestation to the current success of cultural studies while charting Grossberg&#x2019;s intellectual and theoretical developments from his time at Birmingham to the present day. Written over a twenty-year period, these essays&#x2014;which helped introduce British cultural studies to the United States&#x2014;reflect Grossberg&#x2019;s ongoing effort to find a way of theorizing politics and politicizing theory.<p></p><p>The essays collected here recognize both the specificity of cultural studies, by locating it in a range of alternative critical perspectives and practices, and its breadth, by mapping the extent of its diversity. By discussing American scholars&#x2019; initial reception of cultural studies, its relation to communication studies, and its origins in leftist politics, Grossberg grounds the development of cultural studies in the United States in specific historical and theoretical context. His criticism of "easy" identification of cultural studies with the theories, models, and issues of communications and his challenge to some of cultural studies&#x2019; current directions and preoccupations indicates what may lie ahead for this dynamic field of study. Bringing together the Gramscian tradition of British cultural studies with the antimodernist philosophical positions of Foucault, Deleuze, and Guattari, Grossberg articulates an original and important vision of the role of the political intellectual in the contemporary world and offers an essential overview of the emerging field of cultural studies by one of its leading practitioners and theorists.<br></p></p><p>&#34;Lawrence Grossberg is recognized internationally as one of the leading US exponents of the cultural studies project. &#34;Bringing It All Back Home&#34; represents a major contribution to the clarification and further development of that project, and an outstanding addition to the formative scholarship of the field.

Other members of the Corinthian church, however, viewed the body as hierarchical&#x2015;as a microcosm of the universe&#x2015;and were not particularly concerned about body boundaries or pollution. These differing views of the human body (and also of the church as the body of Christ) led to differing opinions on a variety of subjects&#x2015;including the role of rhetoric and philosophy in a hierarchical society, the eating of meat sacrificed to idols, prostitution, sexual desire and marriage, and the resurrection of the body. Martin explores these conflicts by drawing on ancient medical writings, modern anthropological approaches, and feminist and ideological methods of critical analysis. He shows how Paul's understanding of the body prevailed among the less well-educated inhabitants of the Roman Empire, who occupied relatively low socioeconomic levels. The minority who espoused the ideas of hierarchy, on the other hand, were usually of higher social status and were better educated. And it was along these same class lines, Martin argues, that the Corinthian church itself was divided.</p><p><b>Dale B.

She is also one of the founding figures of modern Spanish literature. Her vivid descriptions of her experiences in prayer have long made her an object of intense interest to psychologists of religion. This work makes use of historical research on Teresa and her society and provides an introduction to all her major works. It shows Teresa as more than just a chronicler of paranormal states of consciousness. She emerges as a genuine theologian in her own right, with a powerful contribution to make to contemporary understanding. Above all, Teresa is chiefly concerned to develop a model of Christian life as friendship with God, a God who abandons status and dignity for the sake of human beings. In this book, Rowan Williams also shows how all Teresa&#39;s major writings concentrate on this incarnation theme. In a final chapter he argues that Christian mysticism is itself deeply misunderstood unless it is seen within an incarnation framework.</p><p><p>The Rt.

Ludmerer describes the evolution of American medical education from 1910, when a muck-raking report on medical diploma mills spurred the reform and expansion of medical schools, to the current era of managed care, when commercial interests once more have come to the fore, compromising the training of the nation's future doctors. Ludmerer portrays the experience of learning medicine from the perspective of students, house officers, faculty, administrators, and patients, and he traces the immense impact on academic medical centers of outside factors such as World War II, the National Institutes of Health, private medical insurance, and Medicare and Medicaid. Most notably, the book explores the very real threats to medical education in the current environment of managed care, viewing these developments not as a catastrophe but as a challenge to make many long overdue changes in medical education and medical practice.<br> Panoramic in scope, meticulously researched, brilliantly argued, and engagingly written, <em>Time to Heal</em> is both a stunning work of scholarship and a courageous critique of modern medical education. The definitive book on the subject, it provides an indispensable framework for making informed choices about the future of medical education and health care in America.</p><p><br><strong>Kenneth M.

He is Professor of Medicine in the School of Medicine and Professor of History on the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at Washington University.

He lives in St. Louis, Missouri, with his wife and two daughters.<br>Each year, thousands of bright, energetic, highly motivated students are admitted to medical school. I have often pondered how much formal teaching such bright students really need to become excellent doctors. How much does the curriculum matter? How critical is the environment? I asked myself these questions again after reading the last several chapters of Ludmerer's book. They deal with the profound influences of our current system of health care delivery on medical faculty and on the teaching and learning environment of our major medical institutions. Ludmerer skillfully describes how we got into our current educational turmoil. His account cries out for us to think deeply and thoughtfully about how to educate our students and house officers in the future.<p> In my opinion, Ludmerer, an internist and medical historian in St. Louis, has written the classic work on medical education in the 20th century. Rather than describing the myriad educational programs or techniques set up by individual schools or training programs, he has placed medical students, residents, their teachers, and their institutions in the context of an evolving system of medical practice, medical research, and governmental involvement. From this perspective, he explains how the environment influences students. He explores their mentors and role models: are they caring, do they respect and listen to patients, do they pay attention to details? He expresses concern about the influence on students of the new terms introduced by the conversion of medical care into a marketplace commodity: market share, "throughput," and population health. </p><p> Ludmerer escapes the common trap of historians in which they bracket eras by using dates. Instead, he defines his own periods: an initial period in which the public developed trust in medicine, a middle period of stunning expansion in research and training, and a later period of the erosion of professional values and a deterioration in the environment of medical education. For each of these periods he explores a number of questions: What did the medical care delivery system look like? How was the cost of patient care funded? What were the contributions of federal and state governments to the cost of education? What were the prevailing concepts about the needs of the marketplace for physicians? How did the status of academic medical centers influence teaching programs? How did research support, especially from the National Institutes of Health, influence medical education? </p><p> Ludmerer adeptly describes the ways in which money has influenced medical education for more than a century and points to certain benchmarks, including the proprietary medical schools introduced near the turn of the century, the post-Flexner period of minimal educational funding, the growth in the numbers of faculty members and trainees that resulted from the expansion of the National Institutes of Health, the priming effect of Medicare on income from faculty members' practice, and managed care's assault on the time and income of faculty members. Throughout modern history, it is apparent that cash, not educators, has had the dominant effect on the amount and even the kind of medical teaching. </p><p> In my judgment, this book is mandatory reading for anyone even peripherally involved in medical education, and it will be the basis for all planning for medical education in the next century. It is critical to reflect now on the direction of medical education, not because the famous ball will descend in Times Square to mark the beginning of a new century, but because of the serious threats to medical education as detailed by Ludmerer. </p><p> At no other time in the past 100 years has medical education faced more serious problems. Given the sharp cutbacks in funding for academic medical centers, the new demands on clinical faculty members to bring in more dollars from practice (and thus the reduced time for teaching), the shortened hospital stays of patients, and the biased representation of very sick patients in hospital beds, it is not surprising that many students are now found lacking in the fundamental clinical skills of history taking and physical examination. Moreover, students who begin medical school as idealists become cynical as they witness house officers who treat patients indifferently and physicians and professional organizations that cut the corners of professionalism by adopting a permissive approach toward financial conflicts of interest, product endorsements, and collective bargaining. At the same time, impending technical revolutions, such as the decoding of the human genome and changes in the way we obtain and use information, will have major effects on how we teach, what we teach, and how our students will learn. We ignore these events at our peril. </p><p> Those of us involved in teaching and training must immediately begin to envision the future and plan for it. We have not done so very well in the past. We failed to foresee that the focus of care would switch from acute to chronic disease, that preventive medicine would become important, that the system of care was inadequate for the entire population, or that the cost of care would reach a squealing point. </p><p> We have a lot of questions to ask. We could start where I did: How much formal teaching do superb students really need to become excellent doctors? How much does the curriculum matter? How critical is the environment? How can we teach better outside the hospital? How can we provide students adequate access to teaching materials? Before we begin to address these questions, however, we need to ask much more about the future of medicine. What will doctors be doing 5, 10, or 15 years from now? Will they face the same kind of clinical issues that they do now? Will they be prepared for the clinical consequences of research in genomics? How will the changing ethnic distribution of the population influence where and how they practice? Will globalization of the economy affect medical practice? What models of care delivery are likely to emerge? What will medical records look like, and where will they be kept? Will the current specialties still be relevant? What kinds of stress will influence physicians' dedication first and foremost to their patients? Will computers finally become sufficiently "intelligent" to give good medical advice? Will doctors get information largely as they do now, or will they receive it on line when they actually need it? Will cost have the same critical role in patient care as it does now? </p><p> Planning must continue at the highest level of organizations that contribute to educating students, house officers, and physicians in practice. In the past, such planning was usually done in isolation, with little sharing of resources, as a result of professional competition. Can the information revolution change this approach? Does every educational institution need to develop its own curricular materials? How important will books be? What about paper journals? How promising are new educational concepts such as distance learning and virtual reality -- are they worth pursuing, or are they only the newest buzzwords? What about our current love affair with problem-based learning? Is it effective? Is it cost effective? Is it better than traditional methods? Should we give up trying to do real research on medical education until we know more about the ways in which people think and learn? </p><p> I have fallen into a common mode -- namely, to ask a lot of questions but to provide few answers. I offer no apologies for doing so. The questions often force us to think deeply about issues that are critical to the ways in which we plan for the future. In response to changes in the environment in the past, educators have often made changes in the curriculum and found that these changes energized students and teachers alike for a decade. This approach will no longer work, because changes in the nature and cost of our delivery system and the impending genetic and information revolution are simply too profound to permit that kind of leisurely approach. </p><p> Read Ludmerer's book. It contributes the foundation and inspiration for us to meet the challenges of the coming era. </p><p> <i>Reviewed by Jerome P. Kassirer, M.D.</i> <br>Copyright � 1999 Massachusetts Medical Society.

Brassa� carefully and affectionately records each of his meetings and appointments with the great artist, building along the way a work of remarkable depth, intimate perspective, and great importance to anyone who truly wishes to understand Picasso and his world.<br></p><p>Henry Miller called Brassa� (born Gyula Halasz) "The Eye of Paris." As a photographer, journalist, and author of photographic monographs and literary criticism, he had an uncanny ability to capture the Paris art world of the mid-20th century. <i>Conversations with Picasso</i>, originally published in 1964, is a collection of Brassa�'s memoirs, resurrected from scraps of paper he stored in a huge vase each night after his talks with the famous Spanish painter, whose work he photographed from 1932 to 1962. In keeping with the lively bohemian spirit that so characterized Pablo Picasso's milieu, Brassa� wrote these notes in a vivid, conversational style, and they are now vignettes, of a sort, from a theatrical time capsule. Presented alongside the actual photographs he took during his visits with Picasso, Brassa�'s anecdotes of the artist and his most intimate associates paint an unforgettable portrait of Picasso the master artist and the man. Sly humor and telling details embellish these accounts--in one particularly well-rendered scene, Picasso throws a temper tantrum over a lost flashlight--that vividly depict many of the artist's creative revelations, his insatiable curiosity, and his views on the art of his time, including that of the surrealists. One very strong image depicts Picasso, with brush in hand, using a palette made of newspaper. Confiscated by military censors due to the mere presence of World War II headlines, this photo represents one of the many wartime frustrations Picasso endured, including using a bathroom for a studio and secretly casting sculptures in scarce bronze at night. Underneath the worshipful posturing so prevalent in writings of the time, in which an everyday shopping list of paint colors is hailed as a prose poem, Brassa� offers an intimate chronicle full of loving detail of the impossible yet delightful enfant terrible. Entertaining, charming, light but truly satisfying fare. <i>--A.C. Smith</i><b>Brassa�</b> (born Gyula Hal�sz, 1899&#x2014;1984) was a photographer, journalist, and author of photographic monographs and literary works, including <i>Letters to My Parents</i> and <i>Proust in the Power of Photography</i>, both published by the University of Chicago Press.<br><br><b>Jane Marie Todd</b> is a translator whose books include Brassa�'s <i>Henry Miller, Happy Rock</i> and <i>Largesse</i> by Jean Starobinski, both published by the University of Chicago Press.</p><h2>Mr Lear: A Life of Art and Nonsense</h2><p><b>Acclaimed historian Jenny Uglow brings us a fascinating and beautifully illustrated biography of Edward Lear, shortlisted for Waterstone&#x2019;s Book of the Year, and a <i>Telegraph</i> and <i>Spectator</i> Book of the Year.</b> A scrupulously forensic literary appreciation of Edward Lear and his 'nonsenses' by one of our most cherished historians &#x2013; without losing any sense of fun. Edward Lear&#x2019;s poems follow and break the rules. They abide by the logic of syntax, the linking of rhyme and the dance of rhythm, and these "nonsenses" are full of joy &#x2013; yet set against darkness. Where do these human-like animals and birds and these odd adventures &#x2013; some gentle, some violent, some musical, some wild &#x2013; come from? His many drawings that accompany his verse are almost hyper-real, as if he wants to free the creatures from the page. They exist nowhere else in literature, springing only from Lear&#x2019;s imagination. <br><br>Lear lived all his life on the borders of rules and structures, of disciplines and desires. He vowed to ignore politics yet trembled with passionate sympathies. He depended on patrons and moved in establishment circles, yet he never belonged among them and mocked imperial attitudes. He loved men yet dreamed of marriage &#x2013; but remained, it seems, celibate, wrapped in himself. Even in his family he was marginal, at once accepted and rejected. Surrounded by friends, he was alone. <br><br>If we follow him across land and sea &#x2013; to Italy, Greece and Albania, to The Levant and Egypt and India &#x2013; and to the borderlands of spirit and self, art and desire, can we see, in the end, if the nonsense makes sense? This is what Jenny Uglow has set sail to find out.</p><p>Jenny Uglow 's books include prize-winning biographies of Elizabeth Gaskell, William Hogarth and Sarah Losh. <i>The Lunar Men </i>, published in 2002, was described by Richard Holmes as 'an extraordinarily gripping account', while <i>Nature's Engraver: A Life of Thomas Bewick </i>, won the National Arts Writers Award and <i>A Gambling Man: Charles II and the Restoration </i> was shortlisted for the Samuel Johnson Prize. Her most recent book is <i>In These Times: Living in Britain through Napoleon&#x2019;s Wars, 1793&#x2013;1815 </i>.

His mysterious saviour is an escaped convict, and his determination to help him leads Stenning into a tense and dramatic adventure of intrigue, drug-running and murder.</p><p>Nevil Shute Norway was born on 17 January 1899 in Ealing, London.After attending the Dragon School and Shrewsbury School, he studied Engineering Science at Balliol College, Oxford. He worked as an aeronautical engineer and published his first novel, Marazan, in 1926. In 1931 he married Frances Mary Heaton and they went on to have two daughters. During the Second World War he joined the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve where he worked on developing secret weapons. After the war he continued to write and settled in Australia where he lived until his death on 12 January 1960. His most celebrated novels include Pied Piper (1942), No Highway (1948), A Town Like Alice (1950) and On the Beach (1957).Pilot Richard Stenning vows to help the escaped convict who saved his life in a plane crash in the English countryside. Stenning soon finds himself pursued by police while he pursues a drug-smuggling ring. David Collins reads this adventure story with tongue-in-cheek glee, giving first-person narrator Stenning a tone suitable for Bertie Wooster. His Stenning takes risks and missteps on a higher scale, remaining true to his own code of conduct. This 1926 novel was the first for Nevil Shute, best known for ON THE BEACH and A TOWN LIKE ALICE. Collins takes this work, notable mainly for its author, and elevates it to great fun. Several racial slurs uttered by the hero mar an otherwise good story.

City and suburban design divides us from others in our communities, destroys natural habitats, and fails to provide a joyful context for our lives. In <i>Design for Ecological Democracy</i>, Randolph Hester proposes a remedy for our urban anomie. He outlines new principles for urban design that will allow us to forge connections with our fellow citizens and our natural environment. He demonstrates these principles with abundantly illustrated examples&#x2015;drawn from forty years of design and planning practice&#x2015;showing how we can design cities that are ecologically resilient, that enhance community, and that give us pleasure. </p><p>Hester argues that it is only by combining the powerful forces of ecology and democracy that the needed revolution in design will take place. Democracy bestows freedom; ecology creates responsible freedom by explaining our interconnectedness with all creatures. Hester's new design principles are founded on three fundamental issues that integrate democracy and ecology: enabling form, resilient form, and impelling form. Urban design must enable us to be communities rather than zoning-segregated enclaves and to function as informed democracies. A simple bench at a centrally located post office, for example, provides an opportunity for connection and shared experience. Cities must be ecologically resilient rather than ecologically imperiled, adaptable to the surrounding ecology rather than dependent on technological fixes. Resilient form turns increased urban density, for example, into an advantage. And cities should impel us by joy rather than compel us by fear; good cities enrich us rather than limit us. <i>Design for Ecological Democracy</i> is essential reading for designers, planners, environmentalists, community activists, and anyone else who wants to improve a local community.</p></p><p>Randolph T. Hester is Professor and former Department Chair in the Department of Landscape Architecture and Environmental Planning at the University of California, Berkeley, and Principal in the firm Community Development by Design. He is the author of <i>Neighborhood Space</i>, <i>Planning Neighborhood Space with People</i>, and <i>Community Design Primer</i>."<br><br>"Randy Hester's profusely illustrated book is the fruitful outcome of his life's work in community design. "Design for Ecological Democracy" shows us how to adapt human settlements so that people can get back in touch with the sources of natural creation."--Bill Thompson, Editor, "Landscape Architecture Magazine"<br><br>"This book is a new classic in landscape architecture, and every designer will learn from Hester's depth of insight. He teaches by examples so artfully described that they become parables for urban design."--Joan Nassauer, FASLA, Professor of Landscape Architecture, University of Michigan<br><br>"Hester's call for ecological democracy flows from a lifetime of experience as farmer, landscape architect, political activist, and teacher. This wise, passionate, and inspiring book, full of success stories, is required reading for all who would build communities that are more beautiful, sustainable, and just."--Anne Whiston Spirn, Professor of Landscape Architecture and Planning, MIT, and author of "The Language of Landscape" and "The Granite Garden"<br><br>"Hester welds ecology, landscape architecture, and a fierce commitment to strengthening urban society into a nuanced, realistic vision for this complex era."--John R. Stilgoe, Robert &amp; Lois Orchard Professor in the History of Landscape, Harvard University<br><br>""Design for Ecological Democracy" is a compelling testament for a world that is at once ecologically sustainable, socially just, and inspired by place. Hester sees environmental change as a deliberate and positive act involving environmental competence, compelling form, celebration of everyday life, and design action. He brings together a broad but cohesive set of concepts from disciplines as diverse as environmental psychology, environmental science, medicine, and urban design to form a strong vision for future design practice. This is not a doomsday book but a hopeful and challenging call to environmental and community action."--Mark Francis, FASLA, Professor of Landscape Architecture, University of California, Davis, and author of "Urban Open Space" and "Village Homes"</p><h2>Decision Analysis for the Professional</h2><p>NEW FOURTH EDITION Decision Analysis has, for decades, been the most powerful method available for making decisions under conditions of uncertainty, e.g., new business strategies and new product launches. In this timely book, business consultants McNamee and Celona set forth the practical application of decision analysis for business decision-makers and those who support them. The book clearly illustrates the need for coupling decision process with analysis to create quality decisions. Includes cases and discussion questions. 339 pages.</p><p>The Fourth Edition was updated and published in 2005. The first edition of this book was published in 1988. Since then it has been used by management and professionals in large and small companies throughout the world to educate management and staff members in Decision Analysis, a major application of Decision Science. The authors, experienced management consultants, have worked for decades with the founders of Decision Analysis at Stanford University, Strategic Decisions Group and clients throughout the world in the application of Decision Analysis to a broad range of strategic problems. This book captures both the theory of Decision Analysis as well as its application in the real world in a highly readable, practical manner. <p>-------------</p>Peter McNamee obtained a Ph.D. in theoretical physics from Stanford University. After 10 years of university teaching and physics research, he decided to leave the realm of academia for the practical world of decision analysis. First with SRI International (formerly Stanford Research Institute) and then with Strategic Decisions Group, Peter has worked for companies in many areas, including bidding, energy, consumer goods, oil, telecommunications, chemicals, and insurance. Peter has lectured on decision analysis in the United States and abroad. He feels computer software is essential to making decision analysis more practical. For this reason, he has played a principal role in developing several generations of Supertree(r) software. Peter is presently one of the founders of SmartOrg Inc., a company dedicated to developing systems to help organizations develop superior management skills. John Celona has pursued his long-time interest in making difficult decisions and implementing the choice through a number of disciplines and vocations; first with a degree in industrial engineering and engineering management, then as a management consultant for Strategic Decisions Group, then as a lawyer specializing in litigation risk analysis, then as an independent consultant. Then, things got really interesting as he tried to sit on the other side of the table by being interim CEO of two successive startup companies. John is presently an independent consultant.</p><h2>Forest Ecology</h2><p>Forest Ecology uses an ecosystem approach to understanding the ecology of forests.

It examines the form and function of forest ecosystems and how they change over time in response to natural and human-caused disturbances.<p> <b> <i>James Peter Kimmins</i></b><i> </i> Following an undergraduate degree in Forestry from the University of Wales and an M.Sc. in Forest Entomology from the University of California at Berkeley, James Peter Kimmins, generally known as Hamish, received his PhD in Forest Ecology at Yale University, focusing on the relationship between ecosystem function and herbivore population dynamics. Since 1969 he has been a Professor of Forest Ecology at the University of British Columbia, where he has presented courses on forest ecology, ecosystem classification, ecological aspects of silviculture, environmental issues in forestry, ecosystem function and response to disturbance, and modeling forest ecosystems to undergraduates, graduate students and professional foresters. He has developed and currently tutors a UBC web-based Distance Education course in Forest Ecology. The fifty-three graduate students he has supervised over the past thirty-five years have studied nearly all aspects of forest ecology from ecophysiology to nutrient cycling and production ecology, to succession, landscape ecology and modeling. </p> <p> For the past twenty-six years, Dr. Kimmins has worked to develop ecologically-based forest ecosystem management models, from the spatially-explicit, individual tree stand model FORCEE, to the a-spatial stand model FORECAST, to the spatial, local landscape, complex disturbance patch model LLEMS, and the spatial watershed ecosystem management model POSSIBLE FOREST FUTURES.

The cheerful, home-cooked visual parody and appropriation enabled by electronic media--&#34;Come to where the flavor is,&#34; reads one Berlin handout reproduced here--have spawned a whole new genre, akin to the electronic music it often advertises. These flyers, examples of which range over 20 years on more than 600 pages, are at once art, advertising, branding and community building, and they reflect the fashion, music, art, politics, news, graphics and literature of their eras. FlyerSoziotope is the world&#39;s largest catalogue of them, and it illustrates the entire spectrum of a new media culture with work from Europe and around the world. Editor Mike Riemel, who studied economics, planning and urban sociology, put his education to use by founding Berlin&#39;s Foto-Shop gallery and the Internet radio station, Klubradio, which webcasts from clubs in Berlin. He has marshaled more than a dozen writers whose essays take closer looks, both academic and entertaining, at aspects of the medium&#39;s development, its success and its future.</p><p></p><h2>Texas Indian Fighters: Early Settlers and Indian Fighters of Southwest Texas</h2><p>Originally published in 1900 as <i>Early Settlers and Indian Fighters of Southwest Texas,</i> this volume has been praised by reviewers for more than a century.

Distinguished MIT professor Andrew W. Lo and researcher Jasmina Hasanhodzic interviewed thirteen highly successful, award-winning market professionals who credit their substantial achievements to technical analysis.&nbsp;Together, these lively and candid interviews tell&nbsp;the story of technical analysis in the words of the people who know it best. The first half of the book focuses on the technicians' careers: how and why they learned technical analysis, what market conditions increase their chances of making mistakes, what their average workday is like, to what extent trading controls their lives, whether they work on their own or with a team, and how their style of technical analysis is unique.&nbsp;The second half concentrates on technical analysis and addresses questions such as the following.&nbsp;Did the lack of validation by academics ever cause you to doubt technical analysis? Can technical analysis be applied to other disciplines? How do you prove the validity of the method? How has computer software influenced the craft? What is the role of luck in technical analysis? Are there laws that underlie market action? What traits characterize a highly successful trader? How do you test patterns before you start using them with real money?&nbsp;&nbsp; Interviewees&nbsp;include: Ralph J. Acampora, Laszlo Birinyi Jr., Walter Deemer, Paul F. Desmond, Gail M. Dudack, Robert J. Farrell, Ian McAvity, John J. Murphy, Robert R. Prechter Jr., Linda&nbsp; Bradford Raschke, Alan R.

The introduction discusses Terences enrichment of the comic genre he inherited from the Greeks and the hallmarks of his second-century BC Latin and its grammar. <p> Terences plays are not merely showcases for his superb Republican Latin style. They represent an obvious post-Plautine shift in the comedy Rome inherited from Greece. There is a new respect for the real human situations behind well-rehearsed comic plots, and questions prod the cultural norms that are depicted on stage. </p><p> Latin selections in this edition include sizeable passages from the beginnings, middles, and ends of all six of Terences plays, giving the experience of the general structure of his comedy. Notes illuminate Terences ingenuity in complicating plots, shifting sympathies, and manipulating character types.

Matthew Calarco draws on ethological and evolutionary evidence and the work of Heidegger, who called for a radicalized responsibility toward all forms of life. He also turns to Levinas, who raised questions about the nature and scope of ethics; Agamben, who held the "anthropological machine" responsible for the horrors of the twentieth century; and Derrida, who initiated a nonanthropocentric ethics. Calarco concludes with a call for the abolition of classical versions of the human-animal distinction and asks that we devise new ways of thinking about and living with animals.</p><p><p> <i>CHOICE</i> Outstanding Academic Title, 2009</p>Matthew Calarco is assistant professor of philosophy at California State University, Fullerton.

John McKnight shows how competent communities have been invaded and colonized by professionalized services&#x2014;often with devastating results. Overwhelmed by these social services, the spirit of community falters: families collapse, schools fail, violence spreads, and medical systems spiral out of control. Instead of more or better services, the basis for resolving many of America's social problems is the community capacity of the local citizens.</p><p>An illuminating look at how the experts&#39; best efforts to rebuild and revitalize communities are in fact destroying them.Amid all the hand-wringing about the loss of community in America these days, here is a book that celebrates the ability of neighborhoods to heal from within. John McKnight tells how the experts&#39; best efforts to rebuild and revitalize communities are in fact destroying them. McKnight focuses on four &#34;counterfeiting&#34; aspects of society: professionalism, medicine, human service systems, and the criminal justice system. Because in many areas the ideological roots of service grow from a religious ideal, the book concludes with a reflection on the idea of Christian service and its transformation into carelessness. Reforming our human service institutions won&#39;t work, McKnight writes. These systems do too much, intervene where they are ineffective, and try to substitute service for irreplaceable care. Instead of more or better services, the book demonstrates that the community capacity of the local citizens is the basis for resolving many of America&#39;s social problems.</p><h2>American Imperial Pastoral: The Architecture of US Colonialism in the Philippines</h2><p>In 1904, renowned architect Daniel Burnham, the Progressive Era urban planner who famously &#x201c;Made No Little Plans,&#x201d; set off for the Philippines, the new US colonial acquisition. Charged with designing environments for the occupation government, Burnham set out to convey the ambitions and the dominance of the regime, drawing on neo-classical formalism for the Pacific colony. The spaces he created, most notably in the summer capital of Baguio, gave physical form to American rule and its contradictions.<br><br> In <i>American Imperial Pastoral</i>, Rebecca Tinio McKenna examines the design, construction, and use of Baguio, making visible the physical shape, labor, and sustaining practices of the US&#x2019;s new empire&#x2014;especially the dispossessions that underwrote market expansion. In the process, she demonstrates how colonialists conducted market-making through state-building and vice-versa. Where much has been made of the racial dynamics of US colonialism in the region, McKenna emphasizes capitalist practices and design ideals&#x2014;giving us a fresh and nuanced understanding of the American occupation of the Philippines.</p><p><b>Rebecca Tinio McKenna</b> is assistant professor of history at the University of Notre Dame.<i>&#x201c;</i><i>American Imperial Pastoral</i> is the rare book written for an academic audience that can still appeal to a more general readership. . . . Through revealing the paradox at the heart of the colonial project, McKenna is able to say something new about US empire in general, particularly as practiced in the Philippines. More importantly, she elucidates a fundamental feature of the broader US-American ideal: the enthusiastic universalism many of us see as the core of our national identity is also predicated upon subtle techniques of violence and harmful, restrictive and un-recognized assumptions about the way societies should be organized.&#x201d; (<i>Spectrum Culture</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;2017 Winner&#x201d; (awarded by the Society for Historians of American Foreign Relations <i>Myrna F. Bernath Book Award</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;The entwined pathways of neoimperialism and neoliberalism that evolved in the Philippines are well worth pondering at greater length and scholars interested in exploring these developments will be grateful<br> that McKenna has paved the way for exactly this kind of study.&#x201d; (<i>Diplomatic History</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;<i>American Imperial Pastoral, </i>is a well-written and thoroughly researched book. Rather than focus her attention on the usual urban context of Manila, McKenna shifts our attention to Baguio&#x2014;a part of the American imperial story that has not yet been told with this depth. McKenna cleverly takes the reader on a journey through the landscape of Baguio, moving in a series of elegant chapters from the road to architecture to marketplace to country club, much in the same way colonial officials moved through the landscape in the early twentieth century. Empire is a complicated business and the field of history needs more books like this one to shed light on how American imperialism changed the Philippines in the wake of the Spanish-American War and beyond.&#x201d; (<i>David Brody, author of Visualizing American Empire: Orientalism and Imperialism in the Philippines</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;<i>American Imperial Pastoral</i>&nbsp;is a sharp and deeply-researched study of a place little known to most Americans but central to the American imperial project of the early twentieth century. McKenna powerfully evokes the Philippine landscape, and the dangerous work of constructing an American-style town in hills outside Manila. It was an enormous task that required political justification, enormous expenditures in cash and material goods, and the exploitation and often violent control of Philippine laborers. McKenna has read broadly and deeply in multiple fields; this is a wonderful example of cross-disciplinary scholarship. There is very little written on Burnham&#x2019;s work in the Philippines, and no one has yet provided such a sharp and sophisticated analysis.&#x201d; (<i>Margaret Garb, Washington University, St. Louis</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;<i>American Imperial Pastoral </i>is a revelation. Through McKenna&#x2019;s meticulous research and erudite prose, readers obtain privileged insights into the layered relations of colonial power and resistance, dispossession and capitalism that accompanied the formation of this overlooked outpost of American empire. This is a must read for anyone interested in American colonialism, the Philippines, and the politics of built environments.&#x201d; (<i>Julian Go, author of Patterns of Empire</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;As a &#x2018;complex pastoral&#x2019; built on the shifting grounds of native settlements, imperial conquest, and elite collaboration, the city of Baguio in the Northern Philippines emerged through a process of primitive accumulation. McKenna brilliantly plots the Spanish antecedents of the American colonial hill station and carefully details the planners&#x2019; vision of a racial haven for white rulers based on the economic theft and symbolic appropriation of native land and culture. She examines a range of sites&#x2014;the zig-zag road, the native dog market, the American country club&#x2014;alongside debates between colonial officials and Filipino nationalists&#x2014;to illuminate the contradictions and ambiguities of this colonial pastoral. Lucidly written and theoretically astute, <i>American Imperial Pastoral</i> is an indispensable intervention into the history of the colonial Philippines and in the comparative history of empires.&#x201d; (<i>Vicente L.

First serial, Esquire. Tour.</p><p>This chronicle of freelance journalist Snowden's year in the trenches of America's work force could well serve as a textbook for Modern American Culture 101. Snowden worked as a heavy-metal roadie, an ad copywriter, a substitute math teacher, a Las Vegas cocktail waitress, a Hollywood publicist, a suburban housewife (filling in for a Connecticut matron who took two weeks off), a stripper, a rape counselor, and a molder in a chocolate factory. She gained unusual job skills, like how to sleep in her clothes as a roadie to avoid having to change on a bus; how to mask her limited knowledge of algebra by teaching students the intricacies of restaurant tipping instead; and how to achieve the best hair removal on her bikini line. Beyond these tidbits, Snowden found occupational microcultures with rigid dress codes, rituals, traditions, and hierarchies all their own. With an amateur anthropologist's eye and a large measure of good humor, Snowden confirms and contradicts stereotypes of life in America's offices, casinos, factories, and suburbia. Her fellow ad writers did dream up their toothpaste ads playing Nerf basketball, just like on thirtysomething; playing mom--which each week included doing nine loads of laundry and buying 13 gallons of milk and orange juice, though she was exempt from marital-bed duties--was by far the hardest job, since it had no quitting time. But who would have thought that heavy-metal roadies golf or bowl on their days off or that cocktail waitresses in Las Vegas must join a union, be tested for TB, take an alcohol management class, and have 60 strands of hair cut from their head for DNA testing? While Snowden presents vivid portraits of her jobs, it is not until the epilogue that she explains how she got them, and the absence of any overall conclusions about the American workplace is a drawback. This testament to how deeply jobs shape workers' lives is as invaluable a cultural document as Susan Orleans's Saturday Night. (Photos, not seen) (First serial to Esquire) -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Intrepid journalist Snowden wanted to find out just how much other people define you by how you earn a living and how accurate job stereotypes are. She was also curious about her ability to land nine jobs in one year, a feat she accomplished by offering, when necessary, to work for nothing. Her first incarnation was as a roadie and pyrotechnics technician for the heavy-metal band Skid Row. Moving on from explosives to toothpaste, she secured a position as a copywriter in a New York ad agency and learned exactly why most commercials are so insipid. Snowden was also a substitute teacher, a publicist for a star or two in L.A., and a hand-molder at a chocolate factory. The rest of her experiences centered on gender roles and how women cope with exploitation. She never harps on this theme (letting the facts speak for themselves) or loses her breezy, matter-of-fact tone as she describes her stints as a cocktail waitress in Las Vegas, a stripper in New Orleans, a housewife (she did everything but sleep with the husband), and a rape counselor. Snowden's gutsy forays into these diverse realms reaped some genuine intimations into the nature of work. <i>Donna Seaman</i></p><h2>Saxon Math 7/6 Homeschool: Saxon Teacher CD ROM 4th Edition</h2><p>Saxon Teacher includes: Comprehensive lesson instruction from a teacher with extensive Saxon teaching experience Complete Solutions to every practice problem, problem set, and test problem, including step by step explanations and helpful hints A user friendly CD format with simple navigation &#34;</p><p></p><h2>The Venomous Sea Snakes: A Comprehensive Bibliography</h2><p>A collection of approximately 2800 references, this book contains a comprehencsive listing of the world&#39;s literature on sea snakes from the time of the early Greeks through to 1990.

Together with Reynolds`s award-winning <i>The Later Paintings and Drawings of John Constable</i> (1984), the books are a catalogue raisonne&#x201a; of this artist`s monumental oeuvre.The two volumes, one of text and one of plates, describe and reproduce 1370 paintings and drawings in chronological order. They begin with Constable`s juvenilia and tentative experiments before he went to London in 1799 to become a professional artist. Next are some lesser-known works&#x2015;elegant figure studies of girls, Constable`s first portraits, and his Lake District watercolors. Finally are the works after 1808&#x2015;Dedham Vale: morning, Flatford Mill from a Lock on the Stour, A Summerland, The Stour Valley and Dedham Village, and the recently rediscovered The Wheatfield&#x2015;works that made Constable a major force in British landscape painting. The volumes also include Constable`s numerous sketches of his homeland around East Bergholt and Dedham from this period, drawings on which he based his later masterpieces. An appendix records and reproduces, as addenda to <i>The Later Paintings and Drawings</i>, 94 works produced between 1817 and 1836 that have come to light since those books were published.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><h2>Albion&#39;s People: English Society 1714-1815 (Social and Economic History of England)</h2><p>This second volume of John Rule's major two-volume portrait of Georgian England is a comprehensive and authoritative survey of eighteenth-century society, incorporating the exciting new research findings of recent years.

He takes as his point of departure Nietzsche's conception of the soul as a multiplicity of conflicting drives and personae, and focuses on the task Nietzsche allotted himself "to make a cosmos out of his chaotic inheritance." This struggle to "become what you are" by way of a spiritual politics is demonstrated to be Nietzsche's foremost concern, which fused his philosophy with his life.</p><br><p> The book offers a conversation with Nietzsche rather than a consideration of the secondary literature, yet it takes to task many prevalent approaches to his work, and contests especially the way we often restrict our encounter with him to conceptual analysis. All deconstructionist attempts to portray him as solely concerned with the destruction of the subject and the dispersion of the self, rather than its unification, are called into question. Often portrayed as the champion of nihilism, Nietzsche here emerges as a thinker who saw his primary task as the overcoming of nihilism through the heroic struggle of individuation.</p></p><p>This book offers a conversation with Nietzsche rather than a consideration of the secondary literature, yet it takes to task many prevalent approaches to his work, and contests especially the way we often restrict our encounter with him to conceptual analysis."Thiele offers an accessible and accurate portrait of Nietzsche's ideal of heroic individualism. [In Nietzsche,] Thiele retrieves a creator of values, of a model of the 'well-ordered soul,' a seductive and paradoxical existential thinker with a psychagogic aim."

No longer are research subjects examined through the lens of the all-knowing but supposedly invisible researcher.

The authors carry the novice researcher through the steps of conducting life history research&#x2015;from conceptualizing the project to the various means of presenting results&#x2015;with an eye toward understanding the complex relationship between participant and researcher and how that shapes the project. In addition to examples from their own research, Cole and Knowles bring in the work of a dozen novice researchers who explain the challenges they faced in developing their own life history projects in a wide variety of settings.

Today museums are reliant on new technology to manage their collections. They collect digital as well as material things. New media is embedded within their exhibition spaces. And their activity online is as important as their physical presence on site. </p> <p>However, &#x2018;digital heritage&#x2019; (as an area of practice and as a subject of study) does not exist in one single place. Its evidence base is complex, diverse and distributed, and its content is available through multiple channels, on varied media, in myriad locations, and different genres of writing.</p> <p>It is this diaspora of material and practice that this Reader is intended to address. With over forty chapters (by some fifty authors and co-authors), from around the world, spanning over twenty years of museum practice and research, this volume acts as an aggregator drawing selectively from a notoriously distributed network of content. Divided into seven parts (on information, space, access, interpretation, objects, production and futures), the book presents a series of cross-sections through the body of digital heritage literature, each revealing how a different aspect of curatorship and museum provision has been informed, shaped or challenged by computing.</p> <p><em>Museums in a Digital Age</em> is a provocative and inspiring guide for any student or practitioner of digital heritage.</p></p><p>University of Leicester, UK<strong>&#x201c;<em>Museums in a Digital Age</em> is thus a timely consideration of the role of the digital in the entire spectrum of museum activities...The...volume is...something much more attuned to the digital age which is its basis &#x2013; a highly diverse, even eclectic, collection of papers broadly centred around the subject of the work.&#x201d;</strong> &#x2013; <em>Historic Environment <br></em></p><h2>To Be Two</h2><p>First published in 2001. Routledge is an imprint of Taylor &amp; Francis, an informa company.</p><p>In this major new work, French philosopher Luce Irigaray continues to explore the issue central to her thought: the feminist redefinition of Being and Identity. For Irigaray, the notion of the individual is twinned with a reconceived notion of difference, or alterity. What does it mean to be someone? How can identity be created, or discovered, in relation to others?<p>In To Be Two Irigaray gives new clarity to her project, grounding it in relation to such major figures as Sartre, Levinas, and Merleau-Ponty. Yet at the same time, she enriches her discussion with an attempt to bring the elements -- earth, fire, water -- into philosophical discourse. Even the polarities of heaven and earth come to play in this ambitious and provocative text. At once political, philosophical, and poetic, To Be Two will become one of Irigaray's central works.</p><strong>Luce Irigaray</strong> is the author of the feminist classics <em>Speculum of the Other Woman</em> and <em>This Sex Which Is Not</em> <em>One</em>. Routledge publishes several of her more recent books, including <em>Je Tu Nous</em> and <em>I Love to You.</em></p><h2>John Vachon&#x2019;s America: Photographs and Letters from the Depression to World War II</h2><p>From 1936 to 1943, John Vachon traveled across America as part of the Farm Security Administration photography project, documenting the desperate world of the Great Depression and also the efforts at resistance&#x2014;from strikes to stoic determination. This collection, the first to feature Vachon's work, offers a stirring and elegant record of this extraordinary photographer's vision and of America's land and people as the country moved from the depths of the Depression to the dramatic mobilization for World War II. Vachon's portraits of white and black Americans are among the most affecting that FSA photographers produced; and his portrayals of the American landscape, from rural scenes to small towns and urban centers, present a remarkable visual account of these pivotal years, in a style that is transitional from Walker Evans to Robert Frank.<br><br>Vachon nurtured a lifelong ambition to be a writer, and the intimate and revealing letters he wrote from the field to his wife back home reflect vividly on American conditions, on movies and jazz, on landscape, and on his job fulfilling the directives from Washington to capture the heart of America. Together, these letters and photographs, along with journal entries and other writings by Vachon, constitute a multifaceted biography of this remarkable photographer and a unique look at the years he captured in such unforgettable images.</p><p>"This fascinating book arrives at just the right moment, making a fresh contribution to renewed public and scholarly interest in the New Deal's FSA photography project and its part in the genesis of modern visual culture. Miles Orvell's skillful assemblage of image and word succeeds brilliantly in evoking John Vachon as both gifted photographer and complex man amidst his turbulent times. Vachon's pictures are at once subtle and truthful, and the texts Orvell has written and collected here illuminate the interplay of individual talent, institutional mandate, and popular ideology that powered the FSA's picture making process."&#x2014;Maren Stange, author of <i>Bronzeville: Black Chicago in Pictures, 1941-1943</i><br><br>"Miles Orvell has created an intriguing picture of a talented, introspective man as he goes about his work as an FSA photographer during the late 1930s and early 1940s. The various parts of the book come together to give us a non-fiction view of the USA and provide insight into documentary photography and the whole FSA project."&#x2014;Townsend Ludington, author of <i>John Dos Passos: A Twentieth-Century Odyssey</i> and <i>Marsden Hartley: The Biography of an American Artist</i><br><br>"In this exciting and provocative book, Miles Orvell addresses an extremely important topic in the history of documentary photography. John Vachon's images and correspondence provide a fascinating counter-narrative to the end of American isolation and the coming of World War II. His writings are a trove of information, written with disarming candor and spiced with lively comments not only on his subjects but on a broad range of cultural issues. Orvell's introductory texts are equally compelling."&#x2014;James C. Curtis, author of <i>Mind's Eye, Mind's Truth: FSA Photography Reconsidered</i><b>John Vachon </b>(1914-75) began his long career in photography as a member of the famous Farm Security Administration group that included Dorothea Lange, Walker Evans, and Ben Shahn. The least-known member of the group, he worked for the FSA longer than any of the others, recording in his distinctive style the rural farms, the small towns, and the cities of America, as the country moved from the Depression to World War II. After the war he worked as a photographer for the United Nations and for <i>LOOK </i>magazine. <b>Miles Orvell </b>is Professor of English and American Studies and Director of American Studies at Temple University.

It examines an historical path that begins at the height of the network age with Walter Cronkite and Edward R. Murrow, when the evening news was considered the authoritative record of the day&#x2019;s events and forged our assumptions about what &#x201c;the news&#x201d; is, or should be. The book then winds its way through the breakdown of that paradigm of &#x201c;real&#x201d; news and into its reinvention in the unlikely form of such popularized shows as <i>The Daily Show</i> and <i>The Colbert Report. From Cronkite to Colbert</i> makes the case that rather than &#x201c;fake news,&#x201d; those shows should be understood as a new kind of journalism, one that has the potential to save the news and reinvigorate the conversation of democracy in today&#x2019;s society.</p><p><b>Geoffrey Baym</b> is an Associate Professor in the Department of Media Studies at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro.

Some of it is historical, dealing with new accounts of the European witch-hunts of the Middle Ages and Renaissance. Most of this new information relates to Witchcraft (with a capital W) the contemporary Pagan religion: a Nature- and Goddess-based spiritual path reconstructed from Pagan beliefs and rites, folk magic and ceremonial magic. This contemporary religion, also called Wicca, bears some resemblance to witchcraft as a tradition of folk magic, but has nothing in common with the Devil-worshipping beliefs of the witch-hunts. <p>The original intent of this encyclopedia was to provide a compendium of entries related to the history and aspects of witchcraft, up to and including the contemporary developments of Witchcraft, Wicca and Paganism. Although I have included some cross-cultural entries, the focus of the book is on Western magic and witchcraft. There are new entries on historical figures and topics related to folklore, magic and folk witchcraft. Many entries have been updated and expanded, and given "further reading" lists that will benefit the reader. </p><p>As for contemporary Witchcraft, I have updated entries and added a few new ones. This rapidly growing religion is evolving on its own in its own directions, and probably needs an encyclopedia of its own. I have covered major points and a selection of prominent people. I have not attempted to provide an exhaustive account of the many and ever-changing permutations of, and debates within, Witchcraft and Paganism, nor have I attempted to compile a who's-who list of personages. Witchcraft the religion is but one aspect of the overall subject of witchcraft. </p><p>As in the first edition, I have capitalized Witch and Witchcraft when referring to contemporary religious persuasions, and have left it lowercase when referring to folk tradition and sorcery. The same applies to Pagan and Paganism: capitalized when in the context of contemporary religion, lowercase when referring to pre-Christian religions and rites. </p><p>Because the distinction between Witchcraft and witchcraft can be confusing, I have to side with the Witches who are preferring the term Wicca. I expect the use of the terms Wicca and Wiccan to increase as this religion continues to grow. Nonetheless, there remain many Witches who are firm about retaining Witch and Witchcraft to describe their religion. It is up to the public, then, to learn to distinguish between Witchcraft the religion and witchcraft the folk tradition. </p><p>Paganism is now a topic of serious academic and religious study, and is taking its place among the diverse faiths of the world. Much of the credit for this goes to a contemporary romance with nature, a desire for personal transcendent experience (which Paganism offers), and to the Witches and Pagans who have campaigned tirelessly to educate the public about what they believe and practice. Ten years ago, few were willing to be open in the public. Today, the public can choose from countless books, periodicals and websites. The openness provides an unusual opportunity to watch the evolution of new religions.</p>Don't look for the Blair Witch in these pages; this new edition retains the balanced tone and thorough scholarship of the first. Guiley, author of the previous edition and many other books on occult and New Age topics (e.g., Dreamwork for the Soul; Encyclopedia of Angels), covers both historical witchcraft (particularly the witch trials of Reformation Europe and Colonial America) and contemporary witchcraft and Wiccan and pagan practice in over 500 detailed, clearly written, alphabetically arranged entries of various lengths. The second edition incorporates new historical research on the origins of witchcraft and updates and expands coverage of the modern revival, its most influential leaders, the organizations, and their practices. The bibliography includes many new titles, and most entries list books for further reading. Revised See references and cross references improve access to information, and more than 100 black-and-white illustrations augment the text. General topics or ones tangential to witchcraft such as "Trees" and "Astrology" have been omitted, but entries related to mythology, folk magic, and the occult still appear, giving this book a broader perspective than the more arcane resources on this popular subject.

Shrewd, intellectual, and articulate, she was close to the center of American power over many decades, and extensive archives reveal her as an unparalleled observer of the politics, personalities, and issues of her day. Louisa left behind a trove of journals, essays, letters, and other writings, yet no biographer has mined these riches until now. Margery Heffron brings Louisa out of the shadows at last to offer the first full and nuanced portrait of an extraordinary first lady.<br> &nbsp;<br> The book begins with Louisa&#x2019;s early life in London and Nantes, France, then details her excruciatingly awkward courtship and engagement to John Quincy, her famous diplomatic success in tsarist Russia, her life as a mother, years abroad as the wife of a distinguished diplomat, and finally the Washington, D.C., era when, as a legendary hostess, she made no small contribution to her husband&#x2019;s successful bid for the White House.

In this revealing history of Cherokee migration and resettlement, Gregory Smithers uncovers the origins of the Cherokee diaspora and explores how communities and individuals have negotiated their Cherokee identities, even when geographically removed from the Cherokee Nation headquartered in Tahlequah, Oklahoma. Beginning in the eighteenth century, the author transports the reader back in time to tell the poignant story of the Cherokee people migrating throughout North America, including their forced exile along the infamous Trail of Tears (1838&#x2013;39). Smithers tells a remarkable story of courage, cultural innovation, and resilience, exploring the importance of migration and removal, land and tradition, culture and language in defining what it has meant to be Cherokee for a widely scattered people.</p><p><b>Gregory D. Smithers </b>is Professor of history at Virginia Commonwealth University and author of numerous books and articles about Native American and African American history."Essential reading for anyone interested in the Cherokee, as it deftly documents how they determine who is a blood relative and why that matters, both in the past and today."&#x2014;<i>Library Journal</i>, starred review<br>"Smithers&#x2019; account of the Cherokee is a welcome addition to the literature of American history.

No future work will be able to ignore his interpretation.

Smithers places Diaspora at the center of the last two-hundred plus years of Cherokee history&#x2014;and he does so in startling fashion. Smithers&#x2019; unique contribution shows how multiple migrations defined for Cherokees not only their past but their present and future as a people of multiple communities. Diaspora and migration shaped Cherokee history not only in the era of the Trail of Tears, but during the era of the American Civil War, and through subsequent decades even into the twenty-first century.&nbsp;This is a groundbreaking study of the Cherokee and of migration."&#x2014;Alan Gallay, Texas Christian University</p><br></p><h2>Rhyme&#39;s Reason: A Guide to English Verse, New Enlarged Edition</h2><p>In his classic text Rhyme&#39;s Reason the distinguished poet and critic John Hollander surveys the schemes, patterns, and forms of English verse, illustrating each variation with an original and witty self-descriptive example. In this substantially expanded and revised edition, Hollander adds a section of examples taken from centuries of poetry that exhibit the patterns he has described.</p><p>In the grand tradition of Alexander Pope, John Hollander offers this explication/enactment of poetic form. There are sonnets about how to write sonnets, haiku about how to write haiku, and so on. The writing is clever, entertaining, and instructive, which will surprise no one familiar with Hollander&#39;s work. What&#39;s even more impressive, though, is how often these poems--which could so easily start to feel like homework--engage you emotionally. The sestina about sestinas is beautiful, and, excepting Dylan Thomas&#39;s &#34;Do Not Go Gentle into That Good Night,&#34; Hollander&#39;s villanelle about villanelles is as captivating an example as one will find of the old French fixed form.A pre-eminent American poet, John Hollander has written over sixteen volumes of poetry. He has also published several works of literary criticism and has edited numerous anthologies, including the Oxford Anthology of English Literature. His many honours include the Bollingen Prize, the Levinson Prize, and a MacArthur Fellowship. Rhyme&#39;s Reason won the Mina P. Suaughnessy Award from the Modern Language Association when it was first published. John Hollander is currently Sterling Professor of English at Yale University.</p><h2>Burkhart&#39;s View of the Shoulder: A Cowboy&#39;s Guide to Advanced Shoulder Arthroscopy</h2><p>From a world-famous pioneer in arthroscopic shoulder surgery comes the first step-by-step "how-to" guide to advanced techniques in shoulder arthroscopy.

The timing of its appearance is fortuitous, since at least half a dozen translations of the Greek into modern languages are currently in progress-a clear testimony to wide-spread interest. The book is well organized; its scholarship is very informed and even handed. There is no doubt that the authors have discovered a need in biblical studies and have filled it superbly. -Albert Pietersma, University of Toronto A very inviting book for anyone wanting to learn about the Septuagint, not only those for whom this is a first introduction but also those who know their way in this area. -Emanuel Tov, Hebrew University This book makes a very complex subject understandable and is very fitting for students of the Bible, theologians, philologists, and historians. -Natalio Fern�ndez Marcos, CSIC, University of Madrid This book provides up-to-date information concerning the making, transmission, and significance of the Greek Septuagint, the first translation of the Hebrew Bible. Students and pastors alike will profit from the research of Jobes and Silva, presented in clear and understandable form. -Bruce M. Metzger, Princeton Theological Seminary Invitation to the Septuagint answers the crying need for an up-to-date, well-informed introduction to the Greek translations of the Hebrew Bible. The authors have pitched the work just right for students tenderfooting their way into biblical scholarship. I dare say, though, that many a seasoned scholar who often uses the Septuagint will learn much to improve that use and prevent misuse. Here is a volume not to be missed-good for use as a textbook and good for continuing use as a reference. -Robert H. Gundry, Westmont CollegeAs the Bible of Hellenistic Judaism and of the early church, the Septuagint has long been important to biblical scholarship as an aid for interpreting both the Hebrew Bible and the Greek New Testament. Until now, however, no user-friendly introduction to the Septuagint has been available. Previous volumes presupposed a great deal of prior knowledge about the scholarly discussions that had been going on for decades. Writing for beginning students and seasoned scholars alike, Karen Jobes and Mois�s Silva give the necessary background and provide a primer that is both accessible and comprehensive.

Today, a number of evangelical Christians are converting to Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy and Anglicanism. Longtime Evangelicals often fail to understand the attraction of these non-Evangelical Christian traditions. Journeys of Faith examines the movement between these traditions from various angles. Four prominent converts to Eastern Orthodoxy, Catholicism, Evangelicalism and Anglicanism describe their new faith traditions and their spiritual journeys into them. Response chapters offer respectful critiques. Contributors include Wilbur Ellsworth (Eastern Orthodoxy), with a response by Craig Blaising; Francis J. Beckwith (Roman Catholicism), with Gregg Allison responding; Chris Castaldo (Evangelicalism) and Brad S. Gregory&#39;s Catholic response; and Lyle W. Dorsett (Anglicanism), with a response by Robert A. Peterson. This book will provide readers with first-hand accounts of thoughtful Christians changing religious affiliation or remaining true to the traditions they have always known.

But while Spanish and Catholic Christianity reached the New World in 1492, it was only with settlements in the seventeenth century that English-language Bibles and Protestant Christendom arrived. The Puritans brought with them intense devotion to Scripture, as well as their ideal of Christendom -- a civilization characterized by a thorough intermingling of the Bible with everything else. That ideal began this country's journey from the Puritan's City on a Hill to the Bible-quoting country the U.S. is today. <em>In the Beginning Was the Word</em> shows how important the Bible remained, even as that Puritan ideal changed considerably through the early stages of American history.<br><br>Author Mark Noll shows how seventeenth-century Americans received conflicting models of scriptural authority from Europe: the Bible under Christendom (high Anglicanism), the Bible over Christendom (moderate Puritanism), and the Bible against Christendom (Anabaptists, enthusiasts, Quakers). In the eighteenth century, the colonists turned increasingly to the Bible against Christendom, a stance that fueled the Revolution against Anglican Britain and prepared the way for a new country founded on the separation of church and state.<br><br>One of the foremost scholars of American Christianity, Mark Noll brings a wealth of research and wisdom to <em>In the Beginning Was the Word,</em> providing a sweeping, engaging, and insightful survey of the relationship between the Bible and public issues from the beginning of European settlement. A seminal new work from a world-class scholar, this book offers a fresh account of the contested, sometimes ambiguous, but definite biblical roots of American history.<br></p><p><br><strong>Mark A.

In his lucid prose, Noll clarifies a complex topic and weaves an astounding number of sources into an engaging narrative.

Wood, Professor of History Emeritus, Brown University <br><p></p><br>"<em>In the Beginning Was the Word</em> documents the Bible's ubiquity in the nation's formative years. With massive research and lapidary prose, Noll shows how Scripture provided solace for individuals, authority for Protestants, and warrants for Christendom.

Rowe Professor of Christian History, Duke Divinity School <br><p></p><br>"Mark Noll has written a learned and wise treatment of the power of the Bible in early American history, sensitive to the ways Scripture was invoked on different sides of many disputes.

This book stands as a monument to his scholarly career, in which he has drawn on the insights of American 'historians of American religion' and many other disciplines, but still adhering to his commitment to write history for the edification of the church.

They witnessed the rise of television and the end of the BBC's monopoly. This fourth volume of Asa Briggs's detailed study is based on a mass of hitherto unexplored documentary evidence, much, but not all of it, from the BBC's own voluminous archives. It examines in detail how and why some of the key decisions affecting broadcasting policy - domestic and external - were reached and what were their effects.<br> <br> Yet it is more than an institutional history. One long chapter deals with the changing arts and techniques of broadcasting news and views, politics, drama, features and variety, music, religion, education and sport. It describes a pattern of broadcasting - and a society and culture - already remote from our own. At every point the main contours of society and culture are explored. It ends with the first night of competitive television and with contemporary assessments of the likely impact of television on sound broadcasting and other media.<br> <br> It is profusely illustrated and can be read either as complete in itself or as one fascinating phase in the unfolding history of British broadcasting.<br></p><p>Asa Briggs is at Open University.`Lord Briggs is an exceptionally sure-footed guide through complicated facts ... an outstanding triumph.

In 1934, before starting college, he heard about a special "Midget Village" exhibit at the World's Fair in Chicago. Raabe was hired to participate in that event, followed by years of appearing at other fairs and exhibitions. In 1938, he heard a rumor that MGM was going to make a movie with Judy Garland and "they wanted as many little people as they could find." Through an agent, Raabe was cast in the film. And what follows is his own account of life as a Munchkin on the set of <i>The Wizard of Oz</i> : enduring tough auditions, watching as the glorious Munchkinland set was built, putting up with long days of rehearsal, being costumed by legendary MGM designer Adrian, hob-nobbing on the set with the stars, witnessing various mishaps during filming, being visited on the set by curious Hollywood royalty such as Spencer Tracy and Clark Gable, and much more.<br>Here, too, is Raabe's life after the <i>The Wizard of Oz</i> : His career as an accomplished pilot with the Civil Air Patrol during World War II; more than 30 years as "Little Oscar," spokesman for the Oscar Mayer Company; his charity work and his role as advocate and kindred spirit to Little People everywhere.

Randi Saloman shows that it was by employing tools and methods drawn from the essay genre - such as fragmentation, stream-of-consciousness and dialogic engagement with the reader - that Woolf managed to leave behind the realism of the 19th-century novel.<br><br>Saloman draws on key theorists of the essay such as T. W. Adorno and Georg Lukacs, as well as on more recent scholars of 'essayism' (a term devised by Robert Musil to describe the hypothetical quality of the essay mode). She shows that the essay, as genre and mode, shaped Woolf's writing, and modern fiction more generally, in ways that have not yet been articulated.<br></p><p>'Bravo to Saloman for her pathbreaking study of Woolf's dedication to the essay--as a genre, as a mode, as a way of being in the world.

"I have no memories of Diane Arbus," begins Alexander Nemerov in the first of two meditative essays that comprise this book. "A Resemblance" examines Howard Nemerov's complicated responses to his sister's photography. "The School" focuses on a body of Arbus' work known as the Untitled series, photographs made at residences for the mentally disabled between 1969 and 1971, in the last years of her life. Through their work, the author explores the siblings' disparate and distinct sensibilities, and in doing so uncovers signs of an unexpected aesthetic kinship. Illustrations complementing the essays include numerous examples of Arbus' photographs; paintings by artists as diverse as Pieter Brueghel, Norman Rockwell, Paul Feeley and Johannes Vermeer; and a selection of poems by Howard Nemerov, chosen by his son.</p><p>Even if one does not accept the sometimes metaphysical import Nemerov ascribes to the images, the intensity of his examination of them may well guide one not only to look harder at Arbus&#x2019;s already widely and profoundly scrutinized canon, but at all images. What Nemerov calls &#x201c;the fanatical quality of attention in poet and photographer,&#x201d; he himself has in spades, as well as a rich mystical imagination. It&#x2019;s unlikely that anyone who reads this book will put it down less critical, less observant, or less attentive to the possible, at turns fanciful and profound, relations between things.

Other writers have shown that once we have sufficient food, shelter, and clothing, further material gains do little to improve our well-being. Kasser goes beyond these findings to investigate how people's materialistic desires relate to their well-being. He shows that people whose values center on the accumulation of wealth or material possessions face a greater risk of unhappiness, including anxiety, depression, low self-esteem, and problems with intimacy -- regardless of age, income, or culture.Drawing on a decade's worth of empirical data, Kasser examines what happens when we organize our lives around materialistic pursuits. He looks at the effects on our internal experience and interpersonal relationships, as well as on our communities and the world at large. He shows that materialistic values actually undermine our well-being, as they perpetuate feelings of insecurity, weaken the ties that bind us, and make us feel less free. Kasser not only defines the problem but proposes ways we can change ourselves, our families, and society to become less materialistic.</p><p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGab38pKscw</p></p><p>Tim Kasser is Associate Professor of Psychology at Knox College, Illinois.<p>"Does money buy happiness?

The importance of Kasser's message is difficult to overestimate; it reaches beyond our personal lives to the world situation. The global economy requires for its continued stability and growth that those of us in the West--and Americans especially--consume more and more. A vast media-marketing-advertising industrial complex serves this purpose. As a result of the consumer binge, our individual health suffers, social cohesion declines, and the biosphere is degraded.

There are also somewhat more constant beings with a limited sphere of influence, who collaborate with architectural tasks such as the developing form of a blossom or an insect&#x2019;s wing. One could describe these beings as the spiritual aspect of chromosomes or chemical messengers. There are larger beings who, for example, supervise the entire design of a tree, and then remain allied to that tree throughout its life-time. Such spirits were called dryads in ancient Greece. There are countless stories about how, when their trees are cut down, these beings at first protest, and then grieve, before finally passing away. Incidentally this is the reason that even up to the end of the 19th century many Alpine lumberjacks used to pray to a condemned tree for forgiveness the evening before felling it!<br><br>Ancient beliefs told how, if the dryad was properly forewarned, it would be able to assimilate into another tree of the same species, thereby allowing the spirit being to live a longer life and gain greater experience and wisdom. Fusing with a neighboring tree presents no difficulty for a Dryad because, unlike human beings, they don&#x2019;t have an awareness of self, and are very much anchored into the Dryadic group soul. <br><br>This group soul exists independently from the life or death of individual trees. It is the spiritual formative impulse for a whole species, and lives outside the four dimensions of space and time. It is eternal and therefore indestructible. The old seers from India describe this form of angel as Arupadevas. To a certain extent we can compare them to the human Higher Self. <br><br>An ancient tree makes such an impression on us, not because it is so big, nor because of the size of its energetic field, but because it has had more time to bring into being the presence of the tree angel that works through that species. The spiritual world is more present than with a younger tree, as is the consciousness of the astral or soul being of the tree (the dryad). This situation enables the simpler nature spirits to arrange matter even more perfectly into an expression of the primeval character of this tree. In this way the spirit and soul life of nature is generated more by some trees than others. Certain places in ancient woodland have generated such an intense awareness that across all cultures generation after generation honored them as sacred groves. It was not humans that declared these groves to be sacred; they became so because of their own nature, because they were living embodiments of spirit unified with matter. <br><br><b>0 BIRCH</b> <br><br>The Birch is life&#x2019;s ancient yet eternally youthful nursemaid. Her spirit is a spark of the ancient mother who gives birth to creation. She brings light to the landscape and into the human heart. She comforts us with her graceful youth because she reminds us of the eternal regenerative power of nature: when the time comes, everything is transformed. It is never too late to begin again! This is her message. <br><br>Birch&#x2019;s presence helps us to let go of the past, purify ourselves, and start afresh with an open heart and open arms. Don&#x2019;t cling on to outmoded ideas, feelings of guilt, or constriction. Free yourself from the expectations of others and those you place on yourself. You are so much more than the limited picture you have of yourself. Hide nothing, be fearless. Accept and flow with the changes, sway in the breeze, bathe in the light and create yourself anew! <br><br>Without the presence of Birch, we become numb and stiff. We are paralyzed by the patterns of the past and fear change. If the situation becomes chronic, things deteriorate and become toxic. Mentally we become stubborn and dogmatic, and physically we develop illnesses such as rheumatism. <br><br><b><i>The Oracle</i></b> <br><br><i>You stand naked before God <br><br>Newborn.

Of course, the walnut nourishes us in a material sense though its fruit, but its spiritual gift is wisdom. Coming into accord with the Walnut angel strengthens our foresight, understanding, sensitivity, and ability to empathize. This creates a healthy foundation for our powers of judgment and sense of justice. With the help of Walnut we draw the right conclusions from our experiences and attain a mature and deep understanding of life and its governing principles. Since time immemorial, the gentle power of Walnut has been honored for its contribution to our spiritual development. <br><br>Without the Walnut we act in a superficial, hasty, and shortsighted manner. Ignorance and coarseness gain the upper hand, which quickly leads to misunderstanding and injustice.

Here, in Alan Watts&#x2019;s groundbreaking third book (originally published in 1940), he offers a more challenging thesis: authentic happiness comes from embracing <em>life as a whole </em>in all its contradictions and paradoxes, an attitude that Watts calls the &#x201c;way of acceptance.&#x201d; Drawing on Eastern philosophy, Western mysticism, and analytic psychology, Watts demonstrates that happiness comes from accepting both the <em>outer </em>world around us and the <em>inner </em>world inside us &#x2014; the unconscious mind, with its irrational desires, lurking beyond the awareness of the ego. Although written early in his career, <em>The Meaning of Happiness </em>displays the hallmarks of his mature style: the crystal-clear writing, the homespun analogies, the dry wit, and the breadth of knowledge that made Alan Watts one of the most influential philosophers of his generation.</p><p><strong>Alan Watts,</strong> the author of more than twenty books and a countercultural icon, was also a spiritual philosopher, scholar of Eastern spirituality, Anglican minister, and chaplain at Northwestern University. He died in 1973.<strong>Introduction<br> <br> </strong><br> During the last fifty years the mental life of Western civilization has been invaded by two forces which are having a profound though gradual influence on our attitude to life. One of these forces has emerged from the West itself, while the other has come from far distant lands. At first sight no one saw that these two influences had anything in common, but with the growth of experience it is becoming clear not only that they are, in spirit, closely bound together, but also that their effects reach far beyond the places where they are professionally studied.<br> <br> The first, a product of the West, is the form of scientific psychology associated with the names of Freud and Jung, which bases its research and practice on the idea of the unconscious mind and whose object is the purely practical one of healing the mentally sick. The second force is a product if the Orient, and is the wisdom of ancient India and China which has been revealed to us in its fullness only in comparatively recent years by the labors of scholars in Sanskrit, Pali, Chinese, and Japanese. At first it was thought that the wisdom they revealed was of little more than academic interest, and had the <em>mis�rable vanit� des savants</em> had its way the treasures of Hindu, Buddhist, and Taoist thought would have remained as much a preserve for the merely erudite as Roman law or Egyptian hieroglyphics. It was soon recognized, however, that this treasure of spiritual literature was not only beautiful to read and consider; it was also seen to be of practical use. The ideas and precepts contained in it were not only as true for our own time and place as for the ancient East; they were also, if not entirely new to us, suggestive of new approaches and new ways of adjustment to problems very close to our hearts, and seemed to offer ways of amplifying the wisdom of the West.<br> <br> An inquiry into the relations between Oriental religion and the psychology of the unconscious might be of interest to those who specialize in these things, but the object of this book is much wider. For neither was originally evolved for the express benefit of specialists; their purpose was and is to assist mankind as a whole, and because there are many close likenesses in their method of inquiry they have come to similar conclusions&#x2014;or perhaps it would be better to say &#x201c;working hypotheses.&#x201d; This form of psychology has taught that man&#x2019;s conscious self and its various faculties of reason and emotion are the outward appearance of a hidden, mental universe in which the true origin of his thoughts and deeds is to be found. In other words, it would say that man&#x2019;s true self goes a long way beyond his conscious &#x201c;ego&#x201d; or &#x201c;I&#x201d; which is the unknowing instrument of the unconscious, or of &#x201c;nature-in-man.&#x201d; When the ego is unaware of this condition it arrogates to itself powers and capabilities which set it in conflict with the unconscious, and from this conflict arise the greater part of our psychological troubles. But when we become conscious of the limitations of the ego and understand its relation to the unconscious, then there is some chance of true mental health. This is strikingly similar to many Oriental teachings if we can substitute for term &#x201c;unconscious&#x201d; or &#x201c;nature-in-man&#x201d; such Oriental terms as Tao, Brahman and the like, which mean the (to us) unknown self of both man and life, or nature.<br> <br> It will therefore be necessary to explore these similarities to some extent, but it is even more important to consider what the invasion of our civilization by these two forces can mean for ordinary men and women whose interest in such subjects is purely practical. For the number of people who have such an interest in either or both of these things is much greater than is generally realized. Moreover many religious cults of the present day are considerably influenced by Oriental ideas, especially the many forms of theosophy, occultism and mysticism patronized by so many people whom the ordinary churches fail to satisfy. Therefore we have to ask just what contribution these two forces have to make to the happiness of the average human being wishes to benefit from them without becoming a psychological or Oriental specialist.<br> <br> Many people have tried to answer this question from the standpoint of psychology alone or Oriental philosophy alone. But few attempts have been made to explore the possibilities from the standpoint of both. Why should this be done? Because there are certain elements in Oriental philosophy which are utterly unsuited to Western life and these elements are not easily seen unless brought to the attention by a critical method which only this psychology of the unconscious can provide. Furthermore, psychology has much to gain from the ancient East. In the West psychology is a science; in the East it is very ancient, and in fact it is not correct to speak of Oriental <em>philosophy</em> at all, for in no sense is it philosophy as we understand it. Essentially it is neither speculative nor academic; it is experimental and practical, and is much closer to psychology than philosophy. But the need for a rapprochement between the two has for some time been recognized by the foremost living practitioner of this particular type of psychology&#x2014;C. G. Jung of Z�rich.<br><blockquote>My experience in my practice (he writes) has been such as to reveal to me a quite new and unexpected approach to eastern wisdom. But it must be well understood that I did not have as a starting point a more or less adequate knowledge of Chinese philosophy. On the contrary, when I began my life-work in the practice of psychiatry and psychotherapy, I was completely ignorant of Chinese philosophy, and it is only later that my professional experiences have shown me that in my technique I had been unconsciously led along that secret way which for centuries has been the preoccupation of the best minds of the East.</blockquote>Because of this admission many of his contemporaries have charged Jung with mysticism and departure from strict scientific method. Such charges, however, are based on a very understandable ignorance of the true character of Oriental psychology and of those aspects of it with which Jung has been concerned. These aspects have little or no connection with metaphysical speculation and religious doctrine as such; nor have they a connection with certain sensational forms of occultism so attractive to those who lack discrimination.<br> <br> Our problem is therefore this: What do Eastern and Western psychology taken together have to say about the elusive and pressing subject of human happiness? For this subject is especially the province of psychology as distinct from what we usually understand as religion, or even philosophy. Often the purpose of religion is supernatural experience and philosophy is primarily interested in Truth and their concern with happiness, in its profoundest sense, is indirect. This indeed is yet another reason why Oriental wisdom and the psychology of the unconscious have to be taken together. It is the only profitable way of considering the collective possibilities of psychology from the East and from the West. As we have seen, Oriental wisdom is psychology rather than philosophy and theology, and the schools of Freud and Jung are the only practical forms of Western psychology which have any relation to it. Unlike the older schools of psychology their object is not simply to observe, tabulate and comment on the mental behavior of man. On the contrary, their method is empirical and its aim is to heal and give happiness of the deepest and most abiding kind. This too may be said of Oriental psychology, for the experience or state of mind at which it aims is a conscious harmony with life and nature both in external circumstances and in oneself.<br> <br> The discovery of this kind of happiness is perhaps the chief desire of man, though it is not always expressed quite in that way, for to many the word &#x201c;happiness&#x201d; has unfortunate associations. But I use it here because it is the only ordinary, everyday word we have to denote an oddly elusive and mysterious type of experience, the kind of experience that runs away from you the moment you begin to look for it. That highly intensified form of happiness which is spiritual experience behaves in just the same way; it is like trying to catch soap with wet fingers. Oriental psychology is particularly well experienced in this elusive art&#x2014;need call to mind the popular Chinese proverb, &#x201c;Softly, softly, catchee monkey&#x201d;?&#x2014;and it seems necessary that in considering a problem which occupies so many of our thoughts we should call upon the psychology of East and West alike.<br> <br> The elusiveness of all kinds of happiness is common knowledge, for have we not the saying, &#x201c;Those who search for happiness never find it&#x201d;? This is especially true of that complete kind of happiness which does not depend on external events, which belongs to the very nature of the individual and remains unaffected by suffering. It persists through both joy and sorrow, being a spiritual undertone which results from the positive and whole-hearted acceptance of life in all its aspects. This acceptance, known under many names in the psychology of religion, comes to pass when the individual, the ego, surrenders the conceit of personal freedom and power, realizing that it depends absolutely on that inner, unknown universe which is nature in the human soul. It only exists as an ego to fulfill the purpose of that universe&#x2014;a purpose which, in one sense, it cannot help serving, but which, in another sense, it does not appreciate when laboring under the conceit of personal freedom and self-sufficiency. When, however, that conceit is abandoned an altogether new and more powerful freedom is known&#x2014;the freedom of union or harmony between man and life. But freedom, union, harmony, life&#x2014;these are vague terms, and the things they signify seem to be as elusive as the terms are vague. To them also applies the old truism that those who search for them do not find them. Such ideas are the commonplaces of popular philosophy and psychology, but in this instance the commonplace is but the familiar entrance to a largely unknown and labyrinthine territory of the spirit. Less than a hair&#x2019;s-breadth divides the self-evident from the subtle, and the danger is that in ignoring something that lies right at our feet we may trip over it through overmuch concentration upon remote parts of the horizon or the heavens.<br> <br> The very saying, &#x201c;Those who search for happiness never find it,&#x201d; raises a host of complications for it will be asked, &#x201c;If happiness is not found by searching, how is it found?&#x201d; to which might be added, &#x201c;If happiness is found by not-searching, or by searching for something else, is not this merely an indirect way of searching for happiness, as it were by a trick or deceit? Surely the important thing is not the means employed, direct or indirect, but the motive for employing them.&#x201d; There is still another preliminary question that might be asked on this point: &#x201c;Would it not be true to say that one who does not search for happiness, either directly or indirectly, already has it? Therefore does not the saying that those who search for it do not find it amount to this: those who have it do not search for it; those who do not have it search for it, and thus cannot find it?&#x201d; In other words, happiness is something which you either have or haven&#x2019;t, and if you haven&#x2019;t there is nothing you can do about it except wait for the Grace of God which is something quite outside your control. <br> <br> Whatever the precise answers to these questions it is generally agreed that happiness cannot be had by any form of direct striving. Like your shadow, the more you chase it, the more it runs away. It is not surprising therefore that in ancient religions and modern psychology man is advised to relax his self-assertive efforts and acquire a certain passivity of soul, encouraging thereby a state of receptivity or acceptance, which Christianity would describe as easing-up the tumult of self-will in order that it may give place to the will of God. It is as if man were to empty his soul in order that the gifts of the spirit might pour in, on the principle that nature abhors a vacuum. But whether it is called the giving-up of self, submitting to the will of God, accepting life, releasing the tension of striving for happiness or letting oneself go with the stream of life, the essential principle is one of relaxation.<br> <br> &#x201c;Relaxation&#x201d; is a word often heard nowadays&#x2014;advertisers, teachers of dancing, music, swimming, physical culture, riding, drama, and business efficiency, doctors, psychologists and preachers, all use it in their varying subjects, its popularity being increased by the nervous tension of modern life. It may be used to mean anything from reading a mystery story or the secret of a ballerina&#x2019;s art to the way of life of a sage whose soul is in perfect harmony with the universe. For, like &#x201c;happiness,&#x201d; it is a word of many meanings and is used quite as casually, and this is not the only similarity between the two. Relaxation is something just as elusive as happiness; it is something which no amount of self-assertive striving can obtain, for as it is in a certain sense the absence of effort, any effort to achieve it is self-defeating.<br> <br> These two words have many other equivalents, some of them much more high-sounding, and in writing and conversation men have exalted them to the skies and dragged them in the mud. There need, however, be no apology for using them, for they belong to common, everyday speech and even if countless associations make their meaning confused, confusion is worse confounded by introducing a new, exotic jargon when familiar and accepted words already exist. Even if they call too strongly to mind trite little mottoes on greeting cards or advertisements for someone&#x2019;s cigarettes or patent medicine, such associations can be overshadowed by the knowledge that these same things, under perhaps different names, have been the chief preoccupation of the greatest minds on earth. Other words have had alike fortune, notably the word &#x201c;love&#x201d; which men have made to mean everything from brute lust to God Himself. Such words may drop loosely from our tongues as if the things which they signify were as common as hats and houses; in a few senses they are, but in others they are things which, however common in our dreams, are little known and seldom found in reality. Often they seem quite close to us, as if we should come upon them round the next bend of the road, but this is their special peculiarity. In this they are like a carrot dangled before a donkey&#x2019;s nose from a stick attached to his collar; if he chases it, it runs ahead of him; if he stands still, it remains where it is, so near and yet so far.<br> <br> The fact that happiness is associated with relaxation does not mean that it is impossible to be happy in the midst of strenuous effort, for to be truly effective great effort must, as it were, revolve upon a steady, unmoving center. The problem before us is how to find such a center of relaxed balance and poise in man&#x2019;s individual life&#x2014;a center whose happiness is unshaken by the whirl that goes on around it, which creates happiness because of itself and not because of external events, and this in spite of the fact that it may experience those events in all their aspects and extremes from the highest bliss to the deepest agony.<br> <br> If, therefore, as both Oriental and Western psychology suggest, the most profound happiness is to be found in a conscious union or harmony between the individual and the unknown Self, the unconscious, inner universe, it is clear the problem has a number of peculiar difficulties. These arise for two principal reasons: fir...</p><h2>Hand to Hand: Listening to the Work of Art (Perspectives in Continental Philosophy)</h2><p><p>A leading philosopher and theologian, Jean-Louis Chr�tien uses poetry and painting to explore a theme that runs through all of his work: how human life is shaped by the experience of call and response.

For this new revision, eminent lexicographer Robert Burchfield has rewritten or otherwise enhanced hundreds of entries and has added twenty-four new entries in a special supplement.<br> The volume remains the classic guide to English usage worldwide. Users will find practical help with grammar, syntax, style, and choice of words; clear guidance on usage offered in light of the language of the 1990s, with many new insights into how English is used today; in-depth coverage of both British and American English, together with aspects of the English of Australia; and wide-ranging illustrative examples, including samples from an international selection of newspapers, journals, and periodicals, as well as from well-known authors such as Martin Amis, Anita Brookner, Ruth Rendell, and John Updike.

W. Fowler's classic outrage contained in entries on "Hackneyed Phrases" or "Pedantic-Humour Words." <p> <i>The New Fowler's Modern English Usage</i>, the first revision in more than 30 years, has not arrived without controversy. Some language (and Fowler) purists complain that the book is too liberal at times, noting that usage is common as opposed to correct. Those points are debatable, and, indeed, they're what makes the book's nearly 900 pages so interesting to peruse. The currency of the new <i>Fowler's</i> extends to, in the entry on "Vogue Words," such novelties as "couch potato," "flavour of the month," "on a roll," and the notorious "parameter."</p><br>Hailed by <em>The Chicago Tribune</em> as "the greatest living lexicographer," <strong>Robert Burchfield</strong> was the Chief Editor of the Oxford English Dictionary from 1971 to 1984.

He added that he would be checking into the hospital the following <br>Monday for what he fully expected would be "a quite serious procedure." Less <br>than two months later, this truly amazing person would be gone. He <br>promised to finish the introduction before undergoing the surgery. And he did.<br> A native New Yorker, who at the time lived within a mile of Ground <br>Zero, Gould had been emotionally devastated by the terrorist assault of <br>September 11, 2001 &#x2014; which as he notes in his introduction came one <br>hundred years to the day after his grandfather landed at Ellis Island. Gould <br>had planned to commemorate his family"s centennial on that day by visiting <br>his grandfather"s site of entry. Almost immediately after the attacks, he wrote <br>four short, reflective essays on 9/11 that he managed to include in his last <br>collection, I Have Landed, which appeared shortly before his death. Although <br>he saw the attacks as an instance of "spectacularly destructive evil," he <br>optimistically believed that the terrorist "vision of inspired fear" would never <br>prevail over the "overwhelming weight of human decency" we find everywhere <br>around us.<br> As he read through the one hundred or so essays I"d sent him, <br>Gould at one point observed how everything seemed "shaped by 9/11," <br>regardless of whether an essay was written before or after. Later, I realized <br>how every few years, ever since I launched this annual essay series in 1985, <br>some pivotal event dominates the national attention and dramatically narrows <br>our literary scope. In 1995 it seemed that half the essays I read dealt either <br>directly or tangentially with the O. J. Simpson trial. The nation couldn"t stop <br>talking about it, and many distinguished writers weighed in with insightful and <br>sometimes brilliant commentary. Something similar occurred toward the end <br>of 2000, when the American political process was put on hold during the <br>most bizarre presidential election in our history. Yet coverage of these <br>events &#x2014; as influential and absorbing as they still are &#x2014; did not necessarily <br>find their way into the volumes that featured the best essays of those years.<br> But the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and their <br>aftermath were altogether another story. The written response was <br>overwhelming, and not merely because of the massive news coverage that <br>instantly went into operation. The coverage, commentary, and reportage one <br>could expect; what was unexpected was their astonishingly high quality. I <br>had assumed that thoughtful essays would take months of reflection and <br>deliberation, that the "literature of 9/11" was several years away. I was <br>surprised to see it taking shape before my eyes. As Stephen Jay Gould <br>mentions in his introduction, we could have assembled an entire volume of <br>9/11 essays. Perhaps two or three volumes, I should add.<br> And yet, when I consider the responses to 9/11 more carefully, I <br>realize that I should have expected an abundance of fine essays. The essay <br>always seems to revitalize in times of war and conflict &#x2014; and it"s usually with <br>the return of peace and prosperity that fiction and poetry renew their literary <br>stature. The First World War resulted in an eruption of essays and introduced <br>the work of some of our finest nonfiction writers, many of whom, like <br>Randolph Bourne, took up the pacifist cause. Then the postwar years saw <br>the flourishing of some of our most celebrated poets and novelists, those <br>members of the "lost generation." This was true too in the Second World War <br>(E. B. White published his greatest essay collection in 1942), and it was <br>especially true during Vietnam. It seems to me no coincidence that the <br>Vietnam years saw the emergence of the New Journalism, an exciting and <br>innovative brand of nonfiction pioneered by one of the writers included in this <br>volume, John Sack.<br>`I can"t prove this theory about essays in time of war. The idea occurred to <br>me while reading Czeslaw Milosz"s brilliant long poem A Treatise on Poetry, <br>which arrived in the mail just a day or so before the 9/11 carnage. Though he <br>promotes the value of poetry in difficult times, Milosz prefaces his "treatise" <br>with the recognition that in our time "serious combat, where life is at stake, / <br>is fought in prose." Even if that"s accurate &#x2014; at least in a general sense &#x2014; <br>I"m not sure why. Perhaps in times of conflict and crisis people want to be in <br>the presence of less mediated voices &#x2014; we need more debate and directives, <br>we desire more public discourse. We instinctively turn to writing that displays <br>a greater sense of immediacy and urgency. "These are the times that try <br>men"s souls," Thomas Paine memorably wrote in 1776, in what would be the <br>first essay of The American Crisis. At that moment in history, radicalism and <br>nationalism could go hand in hand.<br> A few weeks after the attacks of 9/11, I hosted a reading of <br>essays from the newly published 2001 volume at Wordsworth bookstore in <br>Cambridge, just a block away, incidentally, from the hotel where, earlier in <br>September, my son and I (we had just moved a sofa into his freshman dorm) <br>stepped out of the garage elevator into the lobby and exchanged uneasy <br>glances with two unfashionably dressed Middle Eastern men who three days <br>later would fly their suicide mission into the twin towers of the World Trade <br>Center. I was apprehensive about the reading, thinking that anything written <br>before 9/11 might now appear irrelevant, na�ve, or just hopelessly dated to an <br>audience saturated with minute-by-minute coverage of wreckage and <br>terrorism.<br> Milosz"s words, however, had stayed with me, and I cited them, <br>suggesting that in these times the essay was perhaps the most suitable and <br>effective mode of response. Here is what I said: "Whatever other <br>consequences they entail, there can be little doubt that the attacks of <br>September 11 will have enormous cultural repercussions, and among these <br>will be a reemergence of the essay as a broadly relevant, even indispensable, <br>genre &#x2014; a vital source of voices, ideas, and personal histories that the public <br>will turn to with perhaps greater attention than ever before."<br> A few months later, I found my observations about the essay <br>independently corroborated by Peter Beinart in The New Republic, who <br>pointed out that an increasing seriousness in the press after 9/11 has <br>resulted in the reemergence of the "non-reported, nonnarrative, political or <br>historical" analytical essay, a genre that in his opinion had gone "deeply out <br>of fashion in the 1990"s." The "new gravity" that Beinart now sees in the <br>magazine world is evidenced in this volume, not only by his own magazine"s <br>contribution (Mario Vargas Llosa"s "Why Literature?") but by the large number <br>of serious and informed essays on education, culture, history, music, and <br>vital contemporary issues. Even the personal essays, with their prevailing <br>medical topics, are grounded in matters of life and death, issues that we now <br>know represented something more to Gould at the time than age-old literary <br>themes.<br><br>The Best American Essays features a selection of the year"s outstanding <br>essays, essays of literary achievement that show an awareness of craft and <br>forcefulness of thought. Hundreds of essays are gathered annually from a <br>wide variety of national and regional publications.

All of us were <br>saddened to hear of Stephen Jay Gould"s serious illness, and then so very <br>soon after we were all grieved to learn of his death. We join in dedicating this <br>seventeenth volume in the series to the memory of this brilliant scientist, <br>thrilling thinker, incomparable essayist, and steadfast humanist.<br><br>R.A.<br>Introduction:<br>To Open a Millennium<br><br>According to calendrical conventions, the third millennium of our era began <br>on January 1, 2000, or on January 1, 2001, by equally defendable modes of <br>reckoning. Either way, we all acknowledge that our favored decimal mode of <br>numeration reflects nothing more than a convention, however sensible, based <br>on our evolutionary complement of digits. Thus, although we count time by <br>decades and centuries, the beginnings of such units cannot transcend the <br>arbitrary and often bear no interesting relationship to the press of actual <br>history.<br> Many commentators have stated &#x2014; quite correctly in my view &#x2014; <br>that the twentieth century did not truly begin in 1900 or 1901, by any <br>standard of historical continuity, but rather at the end of World War I, the <br>great shatterer of illusions about progress and human betterment. We now <br>face a similar problem for the inception of this millennium, one that must be <br>addressed before proceeding with any collection of essays to honor a year for <br>its inception. Forget the old argument about January 1, 2000 or 2001 (and I <br>even devoted an entire book, albeit short, to this subject). To our great <br>misfortune (that is, provided we can assure that events of similar magnitude <br>do not dog the rest of our days), I suspect that future chroniclers will date the <br>inception of the third millennium from September 11, 2001. Any collector of <br>essays for this fateful year must therefore, up front and first of all, address <br>this issue.<br> I was tempted to make a collection solely of 9/11 pieces (so <br>many good ones already, and so many more yet to come), but neither <br>decency nor common morality permitted such a course. We simply cannot <br>allow evil madmen to define history in this way. Moreover, the event occurred <br>late enough in the year to preclude the kind of pervasiveness that might <br>summon such a temptation. But 9/11 stories must be here, and you will find <br>some of the first of the best.<br> As another point about the need to focus on 9/11, no other event <br>of my life so immediately became part of everyone"s experience. (I think we <br>may finally be able to retire that old question, Where were you the moment <br>JFK was shot?) So we all have personal stories as well, and we need to <br>share them, if only to keep the mantra of "never again" as active as we <br>possibly can. For myself, and in briefest epitome, I live less than a mile from <br>Ground Zero, and if the towers had fallen due north instead of downward, my <br>home would have been flattened. I spent my sixtieth birthday in Italy, on <br>September 10, the day before the attack. Flying back to New York on the <br>day itself, I ended up spending an unplanned five days in Halifax, where my <br>plane was diverted, among some of the kindest people I have ever <br>encountered. Finally, in the weirdest coincidence of my life (the kind of event <br>that makes the religious believe, although I remain a confirmed skeptic), I <br>remembered that the history of my family in America had begun with the <br>arrival of my grandfather. I own the grammar book that he purchased for a <br>nickel soon after his immigration at age thirteen, and I have affirmed the <br>correct date (for I have a copy of the ship"s manifest for his arrival at Ellis <br>Island) of the minimally elegant inscription that he wrote on the title page: "I <br>have landed. September 11, 1901."<br> One truly final point and then I promise to move on. History"s <br>verdict remains to be assigned, but we tend to designate our important days <br>by the events they commemorate, not simply by the date itself. Only one <br>exception to this pattern now exists, the one date that must stand by and for <br>itself: July 4. I can"t help wondering (as seems to be the case so far, but we <br>cannot yet tell) if this beginning of our millennium will enter American history <br>as the second example, known either as September 11 or 9/11. I don"t know <br>how to root about this matter, for or against. As a devoted baseball fan, I do <br>believe in the necessity of rooting. Several years ago, I promised Bob Atwan <br>that I would take on one of the yearly "best" volumes as soon as I finished my <br>magnum opus, The Structure of Evolutionary Theory (published in March <br>2002 by Harvard University Press, 1,433 pages, at the unbeatable hardback <br>price of $39.95). I cringed when he sent me about one hundred essays for my <br>selection, and exploded in premonitory fear for an odd reason that I rarely <br>confess: I am a committed intellectual, and I like to read, but in a funny <br>sense the last book that truly inspired me was probably The Little Engine <br>That Could, first encountered more than half a century ago. Still, a promise is <br>a promise, and so I proceeded. And, thank goodness for affirmations of prior <br>hope, I actually enjoyed the task.<br> My overall impressions are scarcely worth the length of the <br>following sentence, and I will surely not detail the reasons for most of my <br>individual choices herein. But &#x2014; and I guess because I primarily write, rather <br>than read, essays &#x2014; I was astonished by the single most salient character <br>of the choices considered together. I knew that "confessional writing" now <br>enjoys quite a vogue, but I had no idea how pervasive the practice of personal <br>storytelling has become among our finest writers. I can"t help asking myself <br>(although all lives are, by definition, interesting, for what else do we have?): <br>why in heaven"s name should I care about the travails of X or Y unless some <br>clear generality about human life and nature emerges thereby? I"m glad that <br>trout fishing defined someone"s boyhood, and I"m sad that parental dementia <br>now dominates someone"s midlife, but what can we do in life but play the <br>hand we have been dealt? (And if I may be confessional for a moment, the <br>line that most moved me in all these essays came from the pen of an author <br>who stated, so truly, for I live this life every day, that nothing can be harder <br>than the undesired responsibility for raising a child with severe handicaps). <br>Still, I hope that the current popularity of confessional writing soon begins to <br>abate.<br> I have made no attempt to gather my choices into subgroupings, <br>but I offer a few comments in three categories to close this introduction. <br>First, among the confessional writings, the number of medical pieces rather <br>stunned me &#x2014; as if we have come to the point where everyone with a serious <br>illness (meaning all of us, at some point in our lives) feels some compunction <br>to share the load. I particularly appreciated Barbara E...</p><h2>Sample Workbook to Accompany Professional Sewing Techniques for Designers</h2><p><p>This companion workbook consists of project instructions and card stock worksheets in a 3-hole binder for convenient storage.

Alfred is the only English King honoured with this name and is credited with various successes (the foundation of a navy, English education system and religious revival). His memory looms large in the English Imagination. The medieval &#39;Life&#39; of King Alfred of Wessex purports to be written by Asser, a monk in the King&#39;s service. This account of one of England&#39;s best loved and most famous kings has been accepted as offering evidence on most aspects of life in early medieval England and beyond. It was used in Victorian times to create a &#39;Cult&#39; of Alfred. Alfred Smyth offers a carefully annotated translation of the &#39;Life&#39; together with a long commentary. He argues that the &#39;Life&#39; is a forgery which has profound implications not only for our understanding of the early English and medieval past but also for the nature of biography and history.

It militarized a conflict that previously had been largely political and economic. And it solidified a series of divisions--of Korea into North and South, of Germany and Europe into East and West, and of China into the mainland and Taiwan--which were to persist for at least two generations. Two of these divisions continue to the present, marking two of the most dangerous political hotspots in the post-Cold War world. The Korean War grew out of the Cold War, it exacerbated the Cold War, and its impact transcended the Cold War.</p><br><p> William Stueck presents a fresh analysis of the Korean War's major diplomatic and strategic issues. Drawing on a cache of newly available information from archives in the United States, China, and the former Soviet Union, he provides an interpretive synthesis for scholars and general readers alike. Beginning with the decision to divide Korea in 1945, he analyzes first the origins and then the course of the conflict. He takes into account the balance between the international and internal factors that led to the war and examines the difficulty in containing and eventually ending the fighting. This discussion covers the progression toward Chinese intervention as well as factors that both prolonged the war and prevented it from expanding beyond Korea. Stueck goes on to address the impact of the war on Korean-American relations and evaluates the performance and durability of an American political culture confronting a challenge from authoritarianism abroad.</p><br><p> Stueck's crisp yet in-depth analysis combines insightful treatment of past events with a suggestive appraisal of their significance for present and future.</p></p><p><p>"This is a fresh, comprehensive, and balanced study that anyone interested in the Korean War--and, more broadly, in the development of the global Cold War--will find the need to read.

His book will teach the student reader that such literature is generically diverse and thematically varied, traditional and innovative, long and short, prolix and reticent. Literature and the Great War will also demonstrate that the conflict resists definitive interpretation and, in consequence, belongs to no one. Rather, it belongs to everyone, and the centenary events will do it justice if they elicit creative responses to individual and collective memories. * Kate McLoughlin, The Times Literary Supplement *</p><h2>Edgar Cayce&#39;s Diet and Recipe Guide</h2><p>Edgar Cayce, America's famous Sleeping Prophet, gave thousands of psychic readings that included dietary guidance.

With little in the way of &#x201c;how-to,&#x201d; the book focuses more on why and showcases eloquent photographs, including a heartbreakingly beautiful portrait of Marilyn Monroe, a naked World War II bomber tail gunner, and the inevitable &#x201c;Emperor&#x2019;s New Clothes&#x201d; work. Equally heartbreaking for far different reasons is Henry Wilhelm&#x2019;s essay &#x201c;A History of Permanence&#x201d; that includes a section called &#x201c;The Totally Lost Kodacolor Era&#x201d; that will leave you stunned by the corporate callousness that&#x2019;s described.

Advances in the fields of genomics, epigenetics, developmental biology and epidemiology have led to the growing realization that incorporating evolutionary thinking is essential for medicine to achieve its full potential. This is the first integrated and comprehensive textbook to explain the principles of evolutionary biology from a medical perspective and to focus on how medicine and public health might utilize evolutionary biology. It is written in a style which is accessible to a broad range of readers, whether or not they have had formal exposure to evolutionary science. <br><br><em>Principles of Evolutionary Medicine</em> is divided into three sections: the first provides a systematic approach to the principles of evolutionary biology as they apply to human health and disease, using examples specifically relevant to medicine. It incorporates chapters on evolutionary processes, molecular evolution, the evolution of humans, life history theory, and evolutionary-developmental biology. The second part illustrates the application of these principles to our understanding of nutrition and metabolism, reproduction, combatting infectious disease and stress, and human behaviour. The final section provides a general framework to show in practical terms how the principles of evolutionary medicine can be applied in medical practice and public health. <br><br>This novel textbook provides the necessary toolkit for doctors and other health professionals, medical students and biomedical scientists, as well as anthropologists interested in human health, to gain a better understanding of the evolutionary processes underlying human health and disease.</p><p><br><strong>Professor Peter D.

Remarkably, it is only in the last 200 years that such concepts as foodborne germs, and the means of combating them (such as antiseptics and refrigeration), have been popularised. Yet in the 21st Century, consumers in the developed world do not accept that the food which they purchase and consume might carry a risk of making them ill &#x2013; that our food should be safe is something we all take for granted.</p> <p>Food safety is a multi-faceted subject, using microbiology, chemistry, standards and regulations and risk management to address issues involving bacterial pathogens, chemical contaminants, natural toxicants, additive safety, allergens and more.

("Choice", 1 October 2013)</p></p><h2>Fractal Concepts in Surface Growth</h2><p>Fractals and surfaces are two of the most widely-studied areas of modern physics. In fact, most surfaces in nature are fractals. In this book, Drs. Barab�si and Stanley explain how fractals can be successfully used to describe and predict the morphology of surface growth. The authors begin by presenting basic growth models and the principles used to develop them. They next demonstrate how models can be used to answer specific questions about surface roughness. In the second half of the book, they discuss in detail two classes of phenomena: fluid flow in porous media and molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). In each case, the authors review the model and analytical approach, and present experimental results. This book is the first attempt to unite the subjects of fractals and surfaces, and it will appeal to advanced undergraduate and graduate students in condensed matter physics and statistical mechanics. Because of the technological importance of MBE, it will also be of interest to scientists, particularly materials scientists, working in industry and research. Interested readers may view a sample chapter by contacting our web site at http://www.cup.org/onlinepubs/Fractals/fracts1.html.</p><p>"I am convinced that the book will become a classic one...and can wholeheartedly recommend it to everybody interested in this interdisciplinary field of rough surfaces and interfaces."

At this level, the book is unique and merits a place on many shelves." Leonard M. Sander, Physics Today<br><br>"This book is an excellent introductory text and could be used for advanced course work in a number of areas. It should be of interest to materials scientists, condensed matter physicists and physical chemists working on surface phenomena....The strength of this book is that it links results from theory, computer simulation and experiment in one unified exposition.

Gregory Dewey, Journal of the American Chemical Society<br><br>"Overall this timely and beautifully produced book provides an excellent overview of some of the most important developments in application of dynamic scaling concepts to surface growth....Barab�si and Stanley have done an excellent job of distilling a decade's worth of work into a readable book that provides the background needed to delve into recent literature in this field. I recommend this book strongly to students studying surface and interface growth phenomena, because it provides an excellent background needed to enter this field. I also recommend it to researchers seeking a comprehensive review of a particular surface growth problem, because the authors have covered most of the important surface growth areas in which scaling and fractal concepts have been used. To non-specialists, this book will also be quite useful as a general introduction to application of scaling and fractals to nonequilibrium surface growth phenomena." Fereydoon Family, Journal of Statistical Physics<br><br>"...the presentation is made with care and rigor.... The book...can be used for advanced undergraduate or graduate courses.

At the heart of this resurgence in popular interest is an increased level of research activity, much of which is innovative in the field of paleontology. For instance, whereas earlier paleontological studies emphasized basic morphologic description and taxonomic classification, modern studies attempt to examine the role and nature of dinosaurs as living animals. More than ever before, we understand how these extinct species functioned, behaved, interacted with each other and the environment, and evolved. Nevertheless, these studies rely on certain basic building blocks of knowledge, including facts about dinosaur anatomy and taxonomic relationships. One of the purposes of this volume is to unravel some of the problems surrounding dinosaur systematics and to increase our understanding of dinosaurs as a biological species. Dinosaur Systematics presents a current overview of dinosaur systematics using various examples to explore what is a species in a dinosaur, what separates genders in dinosaurs, what morphological changes occur with maturation of a species, and what morphological variations occur within a species.</p><p>Whereas earlier paleontological studies emphasized basic morphologic description and taxonomic classification, modern studies attempt to examine the role and nature of dinosaurs as living animals from the perspective of &#34;dinosaur systematics.&#34;Kenneth Carpenter is Professor Emeritus of Nutrition at the University of California, Berkeley.

It is clinically-relevant throughout and uses the theme of infection as its foundation. <em>Microbiology</em> is student-friendly: its text, figures, and electronic resources have been carefully designed to help students understand difficult concepts and keep them interested in the material.</p> <p>The Second Edition includes a robust instructor ancillary package that allows professors to easily incorporate the book&#x2019;s unique approach into their lectures. In addition to the many free resources for students&#x2015;including the E-Tutor, Bug Parade, Flashcards, and MicroMovies&#x2015;the new edition is supported by Garland Science Learning System. </p> <p>The Garland Science Learning System is a homework platform designed to evaluate and improve student performance and allows instructors to select assignments on specific topics and review the performance of the entire class, as well as individual students, via the instructor dashboard. Students receive immediate feedback on their mastery of the topics, and will be better prepared for lectures and classroom discussions.

However, with credit, the book does not ignore the basic science behind infection, with the introductory chapters covering general background information such as the fundamental chemistry for microbiology, characteristics of micro-organisms and host immune response.

Likewise, photography was instrumental in cultivating and maintaining Europe&#x2019;s distinctively Orientalist vision of the Middle East. As new advances enhanced the versatility of the medium, nineteenth-century photographers were able to mass-produce images to incite and satisfy the demands of the region&#x2019;s burgeoning tourist industry and the appetites of armchair travelers in Europe. In this way, the evolution of modern photography fueled an interest in visual contact with the rest of the world.<br><br><i>Photography&#x2019;s Orientalism</i> offers the first in-depth cultural study of the works of European and non- European photographers active in the Middle East and India, focusing on the relationship between photographic, literary, and historical representations of this region and beyond. The essays explore the relationship between art and politics by considering the connection between the European presence there and aesthetic representations produced by traveling and resident photographers, thereby contributing to how the history of photography is understood.</p></p><p><p>Ali Behdad is John Charles Hillis Professor of Literature and chair of the English Department at the University of California, Los Angeles.

Today more than one hundred million people use it: Swahili is to eastern and central Africa what English is to the world. From its embrace in the 1960s by the black freedom movement in the United States to its adoption in 2004 as the African Union&#x2019;s official language, Swahili has become a truly international language. How this came about and why, of all African languages, it happened only to Swahili is the story that John M. Mugane sets out to explore.<br><br>The remarkable adaptability of Swahili has allowed Africans and others to tailor the language to their needs, extending its influence far beyond its place of origin. Its symbolic as well as its practical power has evolved from its status as a language of contact among diverse cultures, even as it embodies the history of communities in eastern and central Africa and throughout the Indian Ocean world.<br><br><i>The Story of Swahili</i> calls for a reevaluation of the widespread assumption that cultural superiority, military conquest, and economic dominance determine a language&#x2019;s prosperity. This sweeping history gives a vibrant, living language its due, highlighting its nimbleness from its beginnings to its place today in the fast-changing world of global communication.</p></p><p><p><b>John M.

Shakespeare's most enigmatic king struggles with the shifting loyalties of his nobles as well as threats from his covetous heirs and the burdens of his own conscience. The play, which abounds in battles and betrayals, explores issues of politics, inheritance, and legitimacy. <br>John's problems are threefold: he has usurped the throne from the rightful heir, his nephew Arthur; his relationship with the Vatican is troubled; and he is highly unpopular with his own subjects. Shakespeare's portrayal of the despised monarch finds a more heroic figure in Sir Richard Plantagenet, an illegitimate son of Richard I. The Bastard, as John's loyal nephew is known, forms the moral center of the play as well as a source of irreverent humor and honesty. A cynical play about power struggles, <i>King John</i> offers a remarkably contemporary mix of history and ironic commentary, balanced in equal measures by elements of tragedy and satire.</p><p>Designed for school districts, educators, and students seeking to maximize performance on standardized tests, Webster&#x2019;s paperbacks take advantage of the fact that classics are frequently assigned readings in English courses.

Jonson's praise is especially prescient, since at the turn of the 17th century Shakespeare was but one of many popular London playwrights and none of his dramas were printed in his lifetime. The reason so many of his works survive is because two of his actor friends, with the assistance of Jonson, assembled and published the First Folio edition of 1623.</p></p><h2>Ada as A Second Language</h2><p>Known as the authority on Ada 83, this text reflects the latest version of the language, Ada 95.

Luckily, this definitely is not the case with natural preserving techniques. Thanks to the nine main methods described in this book, we learn that almost any food can be preserved without nutrient loss. All of the recipes are effective, economical, and easy to do at home. Most of the methods (drying; lactic fermentation; and preserving in oil, salt, or vinegar, for example) issue from a long tradition that has been swept aside by a tidal wave of industrial canned and frozen foods. This tradition holds an immense but lately obscured wealth of gastronomic and nutritional value. Very often, these recipes go beyond merely preserving food: they transform it by enriching it with new flavors, and better than either freezing or sterilization usually can. We also discover that by using less sugar in jams and other sweet preserves, fruit retains its full flavor, without burdening us with additional calories. With 300 recipes describing how to preserve over one hundred kinds of food, this book restores our appetite for traditional preserves that truly are house specialties.</p><p>Deliberately omitting the two most widely used food preservation methods in the United States (canning and freezing), editor Aubert (Hunger and Health: Eleven Key Questions on Farming, Food, and Health in the Third World) presents here an array of old-fashioned recipes for food preservation collected from the editors at Terre Vivante, a French ecological center. The result is a charming, compact collection about how to use salt, oil, sugar, alcohol, vinegar, drying, cold storage, and lactic fermentation to preserve foods. Though the contributors are European, similar recipes and methods were used throughout the world until the advent of canning in the late 19th century. But, since many of the recipes do not meet current American food safety standards, this book is more a curio than a practical handbook; it may, however, be useful for Y2K survivalists and historical researchers. Not an essential purchase for public libraries; recommended only for the most extensive food collections or where demand warrants.ABonnie Poquette, Shorewood P.L., WI <br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.This enlightening book offers options to the traditional methods of preserving fruits and vegetables from the garden by freezing or canning. In a foreword written by Eliot Coleman, the well-known gardener notes how the use of more natural methods serves to enhance the flavors as well as the nutritional values of foods. Contained here are 250 recipes that feature eight different ways to preserve fresh produce. In various instances, spoilage is prevented by using salt, sugar, oil, vinegar, wine, or alcohol. Some recipes preserve foods for weeks, while others keep foods good for many months. Should the millennium bug be a problem, look to this manual for information on how to preserve food by storing it in the ground or a root cellar, by air drying, by preserving with the condiments mentioned above, and by other techniques that deserve wider recognition. <i>Alice Joyce</i></p><h2>Ethics for the Information Age (6th Edition)</h2><p><p> <b> <i>Ethics for the Information Age </i> </b> <i>is appropriate for any standalone Computers and Society or Computer Ethics course offered by a computer science, business, or philosophy department, as well as special modules in any advanced CS course.

Freud&#x2019;s discoveries, including universally-influential concepts like the Oedipus complex and the interpretation of dreams, continue to be applied in many disciplines today. Elegantly and clearly written, each chapter leaves the reader with a solid framework for understanding key Freudian concepts, and an appetite for further knowledge. Accessible&nbsp;for readers inside and outside the field of psychoanalysis, there is nothing at all equivalent in English.</p> <p>The book starts with Freud&#x2019;s life before the discovery of psychoanalysis, spanning from 1856 to 1900, when <i>The Interpretation of Dreams </i>was published. The subsequent chapters are devoted to the presentation of the key notions of psychoanalysis. A chronological perspective shows how Freud's work has been constantly enriched by the successive contributions of Freud himself, as well as his successors. Freud&#x2019;s contributions are also embedded in the daily, clinical practice of psychoanalysis and psychotherapy. The last chapter concerns Freud&#x2019;s life from 1900 to 1939, the year of his death.</p> <p>This fascinating, concise and accessible introduction to the life and work of Sigmund Freud, one of the most influential and revolutionary figures of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, by internationally-renowned author Jean-Michel Quinodoz, will appeal to both professional readers and anyone with an interest in psychoanalysis, psychotherapy and the history of ideas..

However, heritage is open to interpretation and its value may be perceived from differing perspectives - often reflecting divisions in society. Moreover, the schism between the cultural and economic uses of heritage also gives rise to potential conflicts of interest.<br>Examining these issues in depth, this book is the first sustained attempt to integrate the study of heritage into contemporary human geography. It is structured around three themes: the diversity of use and consumption of heritage as a multi-sold cultural and economic resource; the conflicts and tensions arising from this multiplicity of uses, producers and consumers; and the relationship between heritage and identity at a variety of scales.</p><p>Brian Graham is a Professor of Human Geography at the University of Ulster.

In the brief span of forty-four years, dogged by poor health, he made an enormous contribution to English literature with his novels, poetry, and essays. The son of upper-middle-class parents, he was the victim of lung trouble from birth, and spent a sheltered childhood surrounded by constant care. The balance of his life was taken up with his unremitting devotion to work, and a search for a cure to his illness that took him all over the world. His travel essays were publihsed widely, and his short fiction was gathered in many volumes. His first full-length work of fiction, <b>Treasure Island</b>, was published in 1883 and brought him great fame, which only increased with the publication of <b>The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</b> (1886). He followed with the Scottish romances <b>Kidnapped</b> (1886) and <b>The Master of Ballantrae</b> (1889). In 1888 he set out with his family for the South Seas, traveling to the leper colony at Molokai, and finally settling in Samoa, where he died.</p><h2>The School Superintendent: Theory, Practice, and Cases</h2><p>Now in its <strong>Second Edition, The School Superintendent: Theory, Practice, and Cases</strong> provides reflective summaries, pertinent questions, and case studies at the end of each chapter to encourage the reader to engage in reflection by linking content with personal experiences.

The detective Sherlock Holmes - who continues to enthral millions in film and TV adaptations starring actors like Robert Downey Jr and Benedict Cumberbatch - was the creation of Arthur Conan Doyle, whose crime stories have thrilled readers for well over a century. Sherlock Holmes is not only the most famous character in crime fiction, but arguably the most famous character in all fiction. In sixty adventures that pit his extraordinary wits and courage against foreign spies, blackmailers, cultists, petty thieves, murderers, swindlers, policemen (both stupid and clever), and his arch-nemesis Moriarty, Sherlock Holmes, together with his faithful sidekick Doctor John H. Watson, proves himself to be not only the quintessential detective but also the most engaging and entertaining company any reader could ask for. The Penguin Complete Sherlock Holmes allows readers to experience the entire case-history of Holmes and Dr. Watson from start to finish - the stories that have spawned such infamous characters as the devilish Moriarty, the devious Irene Adler and, of course, the legendary hound of the Baskervilles . . . This edition includes a foreword written by crime writer Ruth Rendell. Penguin also publishes, in individual volumes, A Study in Scarlet, The Sign of Four, The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes, The Hound of the Baskervilles, The Valley of Fear, His Last Bow and The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes. &#39;The immense talent, passion and literary brilliance that Conan Doyle brought to his work give him a unique place in English letters.

He set up as a doctor and it was while waiting for patients that he began to write. Sherlock Holmes first appeared in A Study in Scarlet (1887). The Holmes stories soon attracted such a following that Conan Doyle felt the character overshadowed his other work. In The Final Problem (1893) Conan Doyle killed him off, but was obliged by public demand to restore the detective to life.</p><p>Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (1859-1930) was born in Edinburgh where he qualified as a doctor, but it was his writing which brought him fame, with the creation of Sherlock Holmes, the first scientific detective. He was also a convert to spiritualism and a social reformer who used his investigative skills to prove the innocence of individuals.Holmes is a mesmerising creation and Conan Doyle a master storyteller * The Times * The immense talent, passion and literary brilliance that Conan Doyle brought to his work gives him a unique place in English letters...

The advent of AIDS has proven him spectacularly wrong, and in recent years the world has witnessed infectious outbreaks of other highly lethal viruses such as Hanta, Ebola, and Lassa fever. Flu strains are getting stronger and stronger each year. But what, exactly, is a virus? How does it work? And what is the best way to fight it? <br> In <em>Invisible Enemy</em>, Dorothy Crawford offers clear answers to these and many other questions. She shows precisely how viruses, with their amazing ability to mutate, have caused devastating diseases in the past, and continue to pose one of the greatest challenges to science. A virus is disarmingly small and simple--a minute piece of genetic material wrapped in a protein coat. And yet it can cause major chaos. Smallpox killed over 300 million people in the twentieth century before it was eradicated in 1980; at that time, measles still killed two and half million children a year; and the HIV virus is now the leading cause of death in Africa. Crawford lucidly explains all aspects of these deadly parasites and discusses controversial subjects such as CFS and Gulf War Syndrome. She goes on to consider how we've coped with viruses in the past, where new viruses come from, and whether a new virus could wipe out the human race. <br> For anyone seeking a deeper understanding of these remarkably efficient killers, <em>Invisible Enemy</em> provides a compelling account of their history, their effects on us, and their possible future.</p><p>Though the Berlin Wall has fallen, we find ourselves still struggling with an even older enemy in the eternal Common Cold War. Virologist Dorothy H. Crawford has studied the link between Epstein-Barr virus and human cancer for years, and she casts a wary eye through the electron microscope to check up on them and report on our strange and occasionally deadly symbiosis in <i>The Invisible Enemy</i>.<p> This slim book, scholarly but accessible, examines these barely living (or unliving, depending on whom you ask) gene packages with a strong emphasis on their disease-causing antics and the intellectual heroics of the various campaigns of eradication and control humans have waged for centuries. Though biological relativists might cringe occasionally at Crawford's dogged humanocentrism, few of them would really pine for the days of smallpox or embrace the raging HIV pandemic if pressed. Crawford looks at the wake of devastation left by these two viruses as well as her own favorite subject, which is strongly implicated in the formation of many cancers. Going a bit farther afield, she explains the weird behavior of the nongenetic reproduction of prions that cause Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and bovine spongiform encephalopathy; though these scary proteins aren't viruses by any definition, their behavior is similar enough to warrant inclusion. <i>The Invisible Enemy</i>, calmer than its title would suggest, provokes a sense of optimism in the reader. Though the war might last forever, we can hope for fewer and fewer casualties as the years go by. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p><br><strong>Dorothy Crawford</strong> is Professor of Medical Microbiology at the University of Edinburgh.<br></p><h2>Physics</h2><p>The publication of the first edition of Physics in 1960 launched the modern era of physics textbooks. It was a new paradigm then and, after 40 years, it continues to be the dominant model for all texts. The big change in the market has been a shift to a lower level, more accessible version of the model. Fundamentals of Physics is a good example of this shift. In spite of this change, there continues to be a demand for the original version and, indeed, we are seeing a renewed interest in Physics as demographic changes have led to greater numbers of well--prepared students entering university. Physics is the only book available for academics looking to teach a more demanding course.</p><p>Presents a complete, accurate and rigorous study of physics while bringing it forward into the '90s and beyond. The Fourth Edition of volumes 1 and 2 is concerned with mechanics and E&amp;M/Optics. New features include: expanded coverage of classic physics topics, substantial increases in the number of in-text examples which reinforce text exposition, the latest pedagogical and technical advances in the field, numerical analysis, computer-generated graphics, computer projects and much more.</p><h2>Sicilian Vespers</h2><p>On 30 March 1282, as the bells of Palermo were ringing for Vespers, the Sicilian townsfolk, crying &#39;Death to the French&#39;, slaughtered the garrison and administration of their Angevin King. Seen in historical perspective it was not an especially big massacre: the revolt of the long-subjugated Sicilians might seem just another resistance movement. But the events of 1282 came at a crucial moment. Steven Runciman takes the Vespers as the climax of a great narrative sweep covering the whole of the Mediterranean in the thirteenth century. His sustained narrative power is displayed here with concentrated brilliance in the rise and fall of this fascinating episode. This is also an excellent guide to the historical background to Dante&#39;s Divine Comedy, forming almost a Who&#39;s Who of the political figures in it, and providing insight into their placement in Hell, Paradise or Purgatory.</p><p>On March 30, 1282, as the church bells of Palermo were sounding vespers, a crowd of Sicilians fell on a party of French soldiers, the enforcers of Angevin rule over the island. Within minutes the French lay dead. The Palermo revolt spread quickly across Sicily, opposed by Frankish lords and the Italian clergy, and supported by Sicilian commoners, Aragonese infiltrators, and Byzantine spies. Against a complicated multinational backdrop, the noted medieval historian Steven Runciman deftly portrays the tangled world of Mediterranean politics in the 13th century, the apex of the Middle Ages.On March 30, 1282, the Sicilian townsfolk of Palermo slaughtered the garrison and administration of their Angevin King. The massacre came at a climatic moment of thirteenth century Mediterranean history and its background is traced in this volume.</p><h2>Geometric Morphometrics for Biologists: A Primer</h2><p><p>The first edition of <i>Geometric Morphometrics for Biologists</i> has been the primary resource for teaching modern geometric methods of shape analysis to biologists who have a stronger background in biology than in multivariate statistics and matrix algebra. These geometric methods are appealing to biologists who approach the study of shape from a variety of perspectives, from clinical to evolutionary, because they incorporate the geometry of organisms throughout the data analysis. The second edition of this book retains the emphasis on accessible explanations, and the copious illustrations and examples of the first, updating the treatment of both theory and practice.

Dr. Maslow, the pioneer behind elemental concepts including the hierarchy of needs and the human search for self-actualization, innately understood that the goals and passions that so impact humans in their everyday life could be just as applicable-and his own findings just as valuable-in the work environment.<br> <br> The Maslow Business Reader collects Maslow's essays and letters for his many devoted adherents, and introduces his published and unpublished works to readers unfamiliar with Maslow's management breakthroughs. From recognizing and warning against management's natural progression to mechanize the human organization to brilliant discussions of human motivation, Dr. Maslow never fails to instantly recognize the heart and soul of each matter and provide direct, across-the-board solutions.<br> <br> Abraham Maslow's contributions to behavioral science shine on every page. In notes and articles, as well as personal letters to icons B. F. Skinner, John D.

Assembled from the wealth of behavioral research and analysis Dr. Maslow left upon his death in 1970, the enclosed selections reveal a man comfortable with his position in history, tireless in his efforts to better understand what truly makes humans strive to reach their potential, and gifted in his ability to translate the most profound concepts and realities into entertaining, thought-provoking prose.<br> <br> Abraham Maslow is still regarded as the modern world's most articulate, insightful authority on human behavior and motivation. Discover his beliefs and conclusions on worker drives and motivations-as applicable today as when they were first written-in The Maslow Business Reader.</p><p>"The more evolved and psychologically healthy people get, the more will enlightened management policy be necessary in order to survive in competition and the more handicapped will be an enterprise with an authoritarian policy." -Abraham Maslow In a world in which each new day brings a new management theory or strategic proposition, the timeless ideas of Abraham Maslow resonate with unimpeachable insight and clarity. Dr. Maslow, the pioneer behind elemental concepts including the hierarchy of needs and the human search for self-actualization, innately understood that the goals and passions that so impact humans in their everyday life could be just as applicable-and his own findings just as valuable-in the work environment. The Maslow Business Reader collects Maslow's essays and letters for his many devoted adherents, and introduces his published and unpublished works to readers unfamiliar with Maslow's management breakthroughs. From recognizing and warning against management's natural progression to mechanize the human organization to brilliant discussions of human motivation, Dr. Maslow never fails to instantly recognize the heart and soul of each matter and provide direct, across-the-board solutions. Abraham Maslow's contributions to behavioral science shine on every page. In notes and articles, as well as personal letters to icons B. F. Skinner, John D. Rockefeller II, and others, The Maslow Business Reader provides his outlook on:<br> * Management and leadership issues such as customer loyalty, entrepreneurship, and the importance of communication<br> * Ways to build a work environment conducive to creativity, innovation, and maximized individual contributions<br> * Techniques for finding comfort in change and ambiguity, and using them to spur creativity and innovation<br> Amid today's impressive technological innovations, business leaders sometimes forget that work is-at its core-a fundamental human endeavor. The Maslow Business Reader reminds us of Dr. Abraham Maslow's towering contribution to the understanding of human behavior and motivation, and how his efforts can lead to a greater understanding of the twenty-first-century workplace-and the workers who call it home.The late ABRAHAM H. MASLOW is the world's most widely renowned expert on human behavior and motivation. Dr. Maslow has contributed seminal works to the literature of business, applying his ideas on human behavior, personality, and motivation to the workforce.<br> <br> DEBORAH C.

No, we cannot; but yes, we must act as if we do. Some dangers are unknown; others are known, but not by us because no one person can know everything. Most people cannot be aware of most dangers at most times. Hence, no one can calculate precisely the total risk to be faced. How, then, do people decide which risks to take and which to ignore? On what basis are certain dangers guarded against and others relegated to secondary status? &nbsp;This book explores how we decide what risks to take and which to ignore, both as individuals and as a culture.</p><p>"Poses an important question. Why do people emphasize certain risks while ignoring others? In particular, why have so many in our society singled out pollution as a source of concern? . . . Offering what they call a 'cultural theory of risk perception,' the authors suggest that people's complaints about hazards should never be taken at face value. One must look further to discover what forms of social organization are being defended or attacked."--New York Times Book Review&nbsp;"The authors call into question the presumed scientific objectivity of environmental risk assessment. Risk and Culture is a brief book organized around the premise that the selection of particular single issues (such as nuclear power or exposure to asbestos or ionizing radiation) as environmental hazards is culturally determined. The wellsprings of environmentalism in this and other nations, therefore, are not objective, empirical, rational, or free of value judgements; rather, environmentalism reflects moral, economic, political, and other value-laden factors. Judgments about what is or is not a danger are socially selected. . . . this is a first-rate critical analysis."--New England Journal of Medicine&nbsp;"This view of risk as a socially constructed phenomenon is a creative and refreshing addition to the risk analysis literature."--Nature&nbsp;"A shrewd and provocative book."&nbsp;--National ReviewDame Mary Douglas, DBE, FBA (25 March 1921 &#x2013; 16 May 2007) was a British anthropologist, known for her writings on human culture and symbolism, whose area of speciality was social anthropology.

Though entered by thieves in antiquity, the burial of the king lay intact within its nest of coffins and funerary shrines when these two intrepid archaeologists discovered it. This book, originially published in 1933, is the third volume of Carter&#x2019;s magnificent trilology describing the excavation of the two stone chambers in which were gathered many of the boy-king&#x2019;s most splendid funerary treasures.</p><p>Howard Carter (1874-1939), artist and archaeologist, was attached to various epigraphic expeditions of the Egypt Exploration Fund, later joining the Egyptian Antiquities Service as Chief Inspector of Upper Egypt and finally working as excavator for Lord Carnarvon.</p><h2>The Whole World Is Watching: Mass Media in the Making and Unmaking of the New Left, With a New Preface</h2><p>"The whole world is watching!" chanted the demonstrators in the Chicago streets in 1968, as the TV cameras beamed images of police cracking heads into homes everywhere. In this classic book, originally published in 1980, acclaimed media critic Todd Gitlin first scrutinizes major news coverage in the early days of the antiwar movement. Drawing on his own experiences (he was president of the Students for a Democratic Society in 1963-64) and on interviews with key activists and news reporters, he shows in detail how the media first ignore new political developments, then select and emphasize aspects of the story that treat movements as oddities. He then demonstrates how the media glare made leaders into celebrities and estranged them from their movement base; how it inflated the importance of revolutionary rhetoric, destabilizing the movement, then promoted "moderate" alternatives--all the while spreading the antiwar message. Finally, Gitlin draws together a theory of news coverage as a form of anti-democratic social management--which he sees at work also in media treatment of the anti-nuclear and other later movements.<br><br>Updated for 2003 with a new preface, <i>The Whole World Is Watching</i> is a subtle and sensitive book, true to the passions and ironic reversals of its subject, and filled with provocative insights that apply to the media's relationship with all activist movements.</p><p><b>Praise for the original edition: </b><br><br>"No phenomenon in American life cries out for examination more than the impact of the news media on persons, movements, and events. One need not accept all of Gitlin's provocative conclusions to praise the exacting scholarship that has gone into this study of what happens to an anti-establishment movement performing on an establishment stage."&#x2015;Daniel Schorr, commentator, National Public Radio <br><br>"An enormously useful book. . . . Gitlin writes about the way news organizations, as the category implies, 'organize' the news world, both for practitioners&#x2015;reporters, editors, and managers&#x2015;and for the consumers&#x2015;readers, viewers, and perhaps even more important, decision-makers."&#x2015;Frank Mankiewicz, <i>Washington Journalism Review </i><br><br>"Gitlin tells us . . . how the <i>New York Times </i>and CBS reported on Students for a Democratic Society, and how their choices mattered for the development of the 60s movement and the containment of serious political change."&#x2015;Gaye Tuchman, <i>In These Times </i><b>Todd Gitlin</b> is the author of ten books, most recently <i>Media Unlimited: How the Torrent of Image and Sound Overwhelms Our Lives </i>(2002).

This prompted objections from the Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde, who already operated a lucrative casino in the region. Brook Colley's in-depth case study unravels the history of this disagreement and challenges the way conventional media characterizes intertribal casino disputes in terms of corruption and greed. Instead, she locates these conflicts within historical, social, and political contexts of colonization.<br><br>Through extensive interviews, Colley brings to the forefront Indigenous perspectives on intertribal conflict related to tribal gaming. She reveals how casino economies affect the relationship between gaming tribes and federal and state governments, and the repercussions for the tribes themselves. Ultimately, Colley's engaging examination explores strategies for reconciliation and cooperation, emphasizing narratives of resilience and tribal sovereignty.</p><p><b>Brook Colley</b> (Wasco/Eastern Cherokee, Enrolled Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians) is assistant professor of Native American studies at Southern Oregon University.<p><i>Power in the Telling</i> is a unique contribution to Native American studies, and its audience includes not just scholars and students in this field but also Native communities and their allies. . . .

Authored by nationally recognized scholar and behavioral consultant Dr. John W. Maag, this book focuses primarily on students&#39; observable behaviors and the environmental factors that affect their expression. As Maag points out, behavior management is probably one of the most misunderstood concepts in education. Written in an accessible style, this book demystifies stereotypical beliefs and misconceptions regarding the use of reinforcement, punishment, and self-control. Maag offers clear, yet detailed descriptions of proven intervention techniques, supplemented by step-by-step guidelines, real-life examples, sample forms, and visuals that assist you in implementing these techniques in the classroom. Although the techniques described are based on a sound theoretical and empirical foundation, the author limits the use of technical jargon.</p><p>Dr. John W.

How he got there, how-ever, is a drama of bittersweet humor, mortal danger, heartbreaking tragedy, and inspiring triumph&#x2014;more passionate and turbulent than even the grandest opera.</p><p>In Along the Roaring River, Tian relives his coming of age in China during one of its most chaotic periods, the Cultural Revolution of the 1960s and 1970s. Wild and rebellious, nature-loving, emotional, and yearning for beauty, he finds release in underground love songs howled from mountaintops and banned books stolen from boarded-up libraries. Dec-ades after leaving China during the post-MaoAnti-Spiritual Pollution Campaign, he returnsto find his homeland vastly different. Inbetween, more by fate than by design, heachieves success in the most Western of art forms&#x2014;and takes his place among the influential Chinese artists, film directors, and composers of this era, who were all shaped by that terrible time.</p><p>Tian was born to stern revolutionary parents who became important musicians in the People's Liberation Army, enjoying the privileges reserved for officials of New China. The boy showed little promise of living up to his parents' expectations. He hated music. He celebrated the end of his forced lessons at the piano&#x2014;the "big black beast with eighty-eight teeth"&#x2014;when his unsmiling teacher was sentenced to isolation for counterrevolutionary tendencies. Then, when Tian's own loyal Communist parents were sent to a far-off coal-mining town to be "reeducated," young Tian found himself abandoned and alone in Beijing. Without parental supervision, outside politics, and, at age fifteen, assigned to hard labor&#x2014;cutting metal in the Beijing Boiler Factory&#x2014;the young man found himself spiritually free. He even fell in love with the piano-beast, with which he shared his tiny, lonely room. He taught himself accordion and that most decadent of instruments, the guitar. He became a singer by chance, and, after seven years, tricked his way out of the factory and into a musical audition that changed his life. He smuggled watches with gun-wielding gangsters to scrape together enough money to leave China. And then, on his way to Denver to study voice, on his first day in the United States, he went to the Metropolitan Opera and saw the very first opera of his life.

The wide-ranging introduction explores the implicit politics of the novel about the nature of conservatism and liberalism in all their facets; the "woman question"; autobiographical echoes; gambling; and the novel's interest in modernity and the United States. The book also includes an invaluable appendix that outlines the political context of the Palliser novels and establishes the internal chronology of the series, providing a unique understanding of the six books as a linked narrative.

Palliser&#x2019;s measured Whig creed and his unquestioned place at the top of society are quite different in atmosphere from the revolutions that exploded in the mid nineteenth century throughout continental Europe.&nbsp; His ideology favours gradualism and is pragmatic - or English.&nbsp; It is also, on the whole, successful.<br>&nbsp;<br>Trollope wished to avoid obscurity or abstract theory.&nbsp; He believed that &#x201c;of all the needs a book has, the chief need is that it be readable&#x201d; for &#x201c;the primary object of a novel is to please&#x201d;.&nbsp;&nbsp; Giving life to his characters is one way that he does this, displaying them at length, as if to show life&#x2019;s <i>longueurs</i>, unrolling his plots slowly although he wrote at immense speed, scarcely revising at all.&nbsp; Trollope thought that anyone might be trained to be a novelist for it is a craft similar to carpentry, which shocked Henry James to whom the House of Fiction was a sacred place.&nbsp; He suggests in his <i>Autobiography</i> that foxhunting is a better, even more worthwhile, way of passing time, giving the impression that he flung his pen down on completion of his requisite number of daily words and leapt joyfully upon a waiting horse.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;<br>Of the many characters that he created, Trollope most valued Plantagenet Palliser, putting him alongside only the Reverend Josiah Crawley in the <i>Last Chronicle of Barset</i>.&nbsp; For his creator, Palliser stands &#x201c;firmly on the ground&#x201d;.&nbsp; As Duke of Omnium (since the death of his uncle in an earlier novel <i>Phineas Redux</i>) he dominates <i>The Duke&#x2019;s Children</i>, not only by what he does but through the insoluble regret of his past.<br><i>&nbsp;</i><br><i>The Duke&#x2019;s Children</i> shows Trollope&#x2019;s effectiveness.&nbsp; It is not too long, has no sub-plots that drag or are too facetious such as the rivalry between the farmer Cheesacre and Captain Bellfield in <i>Can You Forgive Her?</i> or the romantic carousel of the Reverend Thomas Gibson, the French sisters and Dorothea Stanby in <i>He Knew He Was Right</i>.&nbsp; A late work, it was published in 1880, when Trollope had passed his time of greatest success and only two years before his death.&nbsp; By then, his books were appearing first in serial form in magazines, this one in <i>All The Year Round</i> from October 1879 until July 1880.&nbsp; Other titles considered for it were <i>Lord Silverbridge</i> (the name of the Duke&#x2019;s eldest son), <i>The Duke and His Children</i> or <i>The Ex-Prime Minister</i>.&nbsp; I think that he (or his publisher) made the right choice.<br>&nbsp;<br>The novel is the last in the series beginning with <i>Can You Forgive Her</i>? -&nbsp; published in 1865 (and Trollope&#x2019;s best seller) &#x2013; that features Plantagenet Palliser and his wife Glencora.&nbsp; The Pallisers ascend to high places, partly through birth, partly through merit.&nbsp; Palliser, after the death of his unmarried, uncle, becomes Duke of Omnium and, later, Prime Minister.&nbsp; Glencora is vastly rich in her own right.<br>&nbsp;<br>Palliser appears first in <i>A Small House at Allington</i>, published in 1864, as a minor character: an awkward young man of twenty five, staying at Courcy Castle, in a Trollopian setting of a grand house party, and fumbling towards a flirtation with the stupid, beautiful Lady Dumbello. &nbsp;One of the first things that we read him saying is a brusque protest against Lord De Courcy&#x2019;s unpleasant amusement at Lord De Guest&#x2019;s discomfiture on having been attacked by a bull; &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see anything to laugh at.&#x201d;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here - in the challenge to his older host &#x2013; comes a flash of strength from someone who had not seemed capable of it.<br>&nbsp;<br>Different from his rakish, spoilt uncle the old Duke of Omnium, whose vast possessions and houses he will inherit, Palliser dislikes the aristocratic pursuits of racing or field sports.&nbsp; He is bored by luxury and grandeur, preferring work, especially his scheme to introduce decimal coinage.&nbsp; Unusually for a politician, he is &#x201c;a man altogether without guile and entirely devoted to his country&#x201d;.&nbsp; Most important, &#x201c;no one could mistake him for other than a gentleman&#x201d;.&nbsp; He is also virtuous.&nbsp; Alongside the need to entertain, Trollope had views on what was a desirable life: &#x201c;I have ever thought of myself as a preacher of sermons,&#x201d; he writes in the <i>Autobiography</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;<br>Palliser had become when young, and through family influence, what the novelist believed should be &#x201c;the highest object of every educated Englishmen&#x201d;: a Member of Parliament.&nbsp; Trollope saw the British parliament, presumably both the House of Lords and the House of Commons, as &#x201c;the greatest in the world&#x201d;, admiring its combination of fierce and competitive debate and restrained behaviour.&nbsp; &#x201c;There is nothing like it,&#x201d; he writes in <i>Phineas Finn</i>, the second novel in the Palliser series, or &#x201c;nothing as yet.&nbsp; Nowhere else is there the same good-humoured, affectionate, prize-fighting ferocity in politics....&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>He knew, however (and had seen first-hand while trying to be elected as Member of Parliament for Beverly) that there was dishonesty in the political world, connived at by both sides.&nbsp;&nbsp; In <i>Phineas Finn</i> a Conservative candidate Browborough is charged with bribery and gets off very lightly, to the relief of the Conservatives and the Liberals.&nbsp; Reform was in the air but in the novel political hacks from both parties &#x2013; Roby and Rattler &#x2013; admit to each other that the old corrupt ways are still useful.&nbsp; In <i>The Duke&#x2019;s Children</i>, Sir Timothy Beeswax represents the less admirable side of politics. <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Trollope had failed at Beverly.&nbsp; However, he knew the House of Commons, often attending its debates and learning its procedures from politicians who wished to aid his writing.&nbsp;&nbsp; His success, a contrast to earlier unhappiness and failure, let him meet such people.&nbsp; He became a clubman, taking especial pleasure in the Garrick.&nbsp; He sat on committees, was editor of the <i>Cornhill</i> and <i>St Paul&#x2019;s</i> magazines and often dined out as well as entertaining at his house at Waltham in Essex.&nbsp; After his break-through book <i>Barchester Towers</i>, Trollope&#x2019;s fame and earnings grew fast.&nbsp; There are accounts in mid-Victorian diaries and letters of this jovial, large and loud man.<br>&nbsp;<br>The world of the Pallisers, with its country houses, wealth and power, clearly intrigued him.&nbsp; It is only part of the political and social life of his time: that of the upper and upper middle classes.&nbsp; As always in Trollope, it&#x2019;s the characters that matter.&nbsp; He declared that he lived with these so intensely that he could know how they might behave under almost any circumstance.&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I think that Plantagenet Palliser, Duke of Omnium, is a perfect gentleman,&#x201d; Trollope wrote in his <i>Autobiography</i>.&nbsp; &#x201c;If he is not, then I am unable to describe a gentleman.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Trollope liked his heroes either to be &#x2013; or to aspire to be &#x2013; gentlemen and usually gave them the means to achieve this.&nbsp; His own family, however, had been expelled from the condition which may have been why he put such a value on it.&nbsp; Related to a Lincolnshire baronet, Anthony&#x2019;s father had tried to maintain what must have seemed his natural place, becoming a barrister and sending his sons to the public schools of Harrow and Winchester, yet fell into debt, bad luck, anger, ill health and depression.&nbsp; This condemned Anthony to humiliation; his father could not always pay the school fees or give him as much pocket money as his school mates.&nbsp; The family lived in increasingly wretched circumstances and he was dragged further down by adolescent confusion and gaucheness, what he termed the state of a &#x201c;hobbledehoy&#x201d;.<br>&nbsp;<br>Could the bleak childhood have been exaggerated, perhaps to match Dickens&#x2019;s time in the blacking factory?&nbsp; His older brother Thomas&#x2019;s memories are not so dark.&nbsp; But the young Anthony may have had a worse time than Thomas for the family&#x2019;s poverty and debts came later with the complete failure of their father.&nbsp; Thomas was also their mother&#x2019;s favourite.&nbsp; It was Frances Trollope, author of <i>The Domestic Manners of the Americans</i> and other best sellers, who redeemed the family.&nbsp; Anthony remembered her getting up at 4 am to write at the kitchen table.&nbsp; Later, as if in part emulation, he would be called each day at 5.<br>&nbsp;<br>Patronage saved him; the Trollopes had a friend in the Post Office who secured the boy a job.&nbsp; Although a Liberal, he remained against competitive examinations for the Civil Service, partly perhaps because his poor educational attainments might have made him fail.&nbsp; &#x201c;There are places in life which can hardly be well filled except by gentlemen,&#x201d; he wrote in the <i>Autobiography</i>.&nbsp; Competition throws these open to people of all types, perhaps thwarting men such as Plantagenet Palliser, Duke of Omnium, who are without ambition or guile.<br>&nbsp;<br>Trollope, like Palliser, was a Whig, or a Liberal with conservative leanings: a belief that for years had attracted aristocrats but came to have less meaning or possibility as the nineteenth century faded.&nbsp; <i>The Duke&#x2019;s Children</i> came out in 1880 when aristocratic power (or power of the great rural landlords) was waning.&nbsp;&nbsp; Agriculture was in decline and new men, from manufacturing or finance, were in the ascendant, often becoming peers themselves; the franchise had already been extended in a series of reform acts.&nbsp;&nbsp; There were, however, still rich landowners with urban property or minerals such as coal or iron ore and certain families still had parliamentary seats where they still influenced the selection of a candidate.&nbsp; Also, the idea of the gentleman had stayed powerful, reflected in the revival of interest in medieval chivalry.<br>&nbsp;<br>But what is a gentleman?&nbsp; Trollope suggests that money and inheritance are not enough.&nbsp; In <i>A Small House at Allington</i>, Crosbie considers the ancient De Courcy family of Courcy Castle and the Hartletop family of Shropshire, measuring them against the Dales of Allington who are small squires.&nbsp; The De Courcys, he thinks, are arrogant, hollow, hard, soulless compared to the Dales.&nbsp; Yet their grandeur has conquered his reason; after all &#x201c;Satan knew that heaven was better than hell; but he found himself to be fitter for the latter place&#x201d;, for Crosbie is a villain.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some twenty years later, Henry James wrote of the effect of such seductive powers on Hyacinth Robinson in <i>The Princess Casamassima</i> and Isabel Archer in <i>The Portrait of a Lady</i>.&nbsp; <i>The Duke&#x2019;s Children</i> also pitches an American girl, Isabel Boncassen, into this exotic and proudly unequal world. <br>&nbsp;<br>The chaotic and decadent De Courcys, with their vicious quarrels between father and son, are different from the Pallisers.&nbsp; The old Duke of Omnium is sensible in his discretion and good relations with Plantagenet Palliser, his heir.&nbsp; Although selfish and immoral, he is one version of a Duke, in his elegance, pleasures and mystery.&nbsp;&nbsp; By the time of his death, insouciance and style have made the old man strangely totemic, even (as Trollope writes) a &#x201c;necessary&#x201d;, figure.&nbsp; Doubt is expressed in the clubs as to whether the heir &#x2013; the irreproachable Palliser &#x2013; can match the old man.<br>&nbsp;<br>But perhaps a gentleman should not be too interesting or too stylish; clearly the old Duke, in spite of his grandeur, is not one.&nbsp; Trollope seems to have believed that gentlemen were more likely to be those who do not have great fortunes: perhaps squires such as the Dales or landowners based principally in the country for country houses were to him the most perfect expression of England.&nbsp; &#x201c;Visitors to England who have not sojourned at a country-house, whether it be squire&#x2019;s, parson&#x2019;s, or farmer&#x2019;s, have not seen the most English phase of the country,&#x201d; Trollope wrote.<br>&nbsp;<br>Palliser, although hugely rich, has complete integrity and scorn for material things.&nbsp; He has also pride and humility, works very hard, but is dull and literal minded, lacking in fantasy, almost a prig.&nbsp; Trollope, as if to balance these deficiencies, gives his &#x201c;Planty Pal&#x201d; a wife of a very different type.&nbsp; Lady Glencora has charm and social ease although she can be silly and rash.&nbsp; &#x201c;There was no woman then in London better able to talk to a dozen people on a dozen subjects,&#x201d; Trollope writes of her in <i>Phineas Finn</i>.&nbsp; The emotional gap between them is clear in Palliser&#x2019;s tentative words when, as a young Member of Parliament and heir to a fortune, he asks her to marry him: &#x201c;You have heard what our friends wish?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>There is ice in this arranged marriage.&nbsp; Early on, she almost leaves him and he has to break off from duties as Chancellor of the Exchequer to take her on a long journey to the continent, away from the infinitely more dashing Burgo Fitzgerald.&nbsp; Plantagenet and she learn to be friends, even to be almost in love, aided (for Glencora) by his success which brings her admiration and position.<br>&nbsp;<br>Six long novels chart the rise of the Pallisers, also encompassing much else, including the dramas of the adventuress Lizzie Eustace (in <i>The Eustace Diamonds</i>) and the romantic and political life of the charming Irishman Phineas Finn.&nbsp;

It is vivid, entertaining, and extremely instructive. It will be found of absorbing interest both by those who already know the Critique and by those - if there are any such - who have a developed interest in philosophy, yet no direct acquaintance with Kant. These last it will surely drive to the text and, as surely, will drive them to approach it in a truly philosophical spirit. Bennett&#39;s Kant is not a giant immersed, or frozen, in time. He is a great contemporary - a little out of touch, admittedly, with recent developments in mathematics and physics - but one with whom we can all argue, against him, at his side, or obliquely to him. And so Bennett does argue, continuously, fiercely, and fruitfully; and summons to join in the argument, at appropriate moments, those older contemporaries, Locke, Leibniz, Berkeley, and Hume, and those younger contemporaries, Wittgenstein, Ryle, Ayler, Quine, Quinton, Warnock, and others. This is splendid, and a necessary corrective to that extraordinary isolation in which Kant tends to be islanded, partly indeed, by his own unique qualities, but partly by oceans of the wrong kind of respect. Bennett, continuously engaging his great antagonist, shows the right kind.&#39;</p><p>A critical exposition and evaluation of the ideas contained in the first half of Kant&#39;s Critique of Pure Reason.Jonathan Bennett is Emeritus Professor of Philosophy at Syracuse University.

Thus young Walter Hartright first meets the mysterious woman in white in what soon became one of the most popular novels of the nineteenth century. Secrets, mistaken identities, surprise revelations, amnesia, locked rooms and locked asylums, and an unorthodox villain made this mystery thriller an instant success when it first appeared in 1860, and it has continued to enthrall readers ever since. From the hero's foreboding before his arrival at Limmeridge House to the nefarious plot concerning the beautiful Laura, the breathtaking tension of Collin's narrative created a new literary genre of suspense fiction, which profoundly shaped the course of English popular writing. Collins other great mystery, <i>The Moonstone</i>, has been called the finest detective story ever written, but it was this work that so gripped the imagination of the world that Wilkie Collins had his own tombstone inscribed: "Author of <i>The Woman In White</i>. . . "On a lonely moonlit road, a young drawing teacher meets a mysterious woman, dressed all in white, only to be struck by her eerie resemblance to his pupil, the beautiful heiress Laura Fairlie. Who is this ghostly woman in white? And what secret does she hold over Sir Percival Glyde, Laura s sinister fianc�? This gripping dramatization of the classic Victorian suspense novel opens in a London courtroom, where an inquiry into Laura s suspicious death is underway. As various characters recount the weeks leading up to her marriage and sudden illness, Collins s chilling tale of love, greed, and insanity springs to life with the aid of a brilliant cast, including Stratford Festival star Douglas Campbell as the diabolical Count Fosco.</p><h2>Flux Cored Arc Welding Handbook</h2><p>Flux Cored Arc Welding Handbook provides comprehensive coverage of gas-shielded (FCAW-G) and self-shielded (FCAW-S) flux cored arc welding processes.

In exploring these relationships for the North Carolina coast, this work examines the manner in which pottery traits cross-cut taxonomic types, tests the proposition that communities of practice existed at several scales, and questions the fundamental notion of ceramic types as ethnic markers. <br><br>Ethnoarchaeological case studies provide a means of assessing the mechanics of how social structure and gender roles may have affected the transmission of pottery-making techniques and how socio-cultural boundaries are reflected in the distribution of ceramic traditions. Another very valuable source of information about past practices is replication experimentation, which provides a means of understanding the practical techniques that lie behind the observable traits, thereby improving our understanding of how certain techniques may have influenced the transmission of traits from one potter to another. Both methods are employed in this study to interpret the meaning of pottery as an indicator of social activity on the North Carolina coast. <br><br><b><br></b></p><p><p><b>Joseph M.

The lightness of Matalon&#x2019;s tale belies its heft. In prose that is both abrupt and tender, she skewers the hydraulics of family and the insensitivities of those who think themselves exquisitely sensitive ... Matalon ... indicts us all.&#x201c;<br>&#x2015;<b><i>The New York Times Book Review</i></b></p><p></p><p>A young bride shuts herself up in a bedroom on her wedding day, refusing to get married. In this moving and humorous look at contemporary Israel and the chaotic ups and downs of love everywhere, her family gathers outside the locked door, not knowing what to do. The bride's mother has lost a younger daughter in unclear circumstances. Her grandmother is hard of hearing, yet seems to understand her better than anyone. A male cousin who likes to wear women&#x2019;s clothes and jewelry clings to his grandmother like a little boy. The family tries an array of unusual tactics to ensure the wedding goes ahead, including calling in a psychologist specializing in brides who change their mind and a ladder truck from the Palestinian Authority electrical company. The only communication they receive from behind the door are scribbled notes, one of them a cryptic poem about a prodigal daughter returning home. The harder they try to reach the defiant woman, the more the despairing groom is convinced her refusal should be respected. But what, exactly, ought to be respected? Is this merely a case of cold feet? A feminist statement? Or a mourning ritual for a lost sister? This provocative and highly entertaining novel lingers long after its final page.</p></p><p><b>Ronit Matalon</b> (1959-2017) was the author of nine novels and a liberal social activist.

This printer's term refers to designs, usually pictorial, engraved on wood, or stereotyped in metal from wood blocks, with one or more hole sawn into the plates so type could be inserted. Less strictly, it applies to the images printed from such cuts. In some 19th-century specimen books, the word "pierced" is used as a synonym for "mortised."<br>These cuts, perhaps more than any other genre of advertising art, conveys a period feeling so distinctive that they are among the most-sought-after graphic elements from 19th-century sources. For all their popularity, both then and now, these cuts are widely scattered through files of old periodicals and typefounders' and engravers' catalogues. The present collection represent an extensive search through rare printed materials too numerous to list here.<br>The collection features 551 of the most interesting and versatile images, arranged in categories. Anyone who has tried to find a vaguely remembered cut in one of the old specimen books, in which cuts were usually arranged haphazardly, will appreciate this organization, especially considering the sheer number of designs contained in the book. It is probably the largest and most varied compendium exclusively devoted to this genre of wood-engraving available today.</p></p><p></p><h2>The Conference of the Birds</h2><p><p><strong>Award-winning translator Sholeh Wolp� recaptures the beauty and lyricism of one of Persian literature&#x2019;s most celebrated masterpieces.</strong></p><p>Considered by Rumi to be &#x201c;the master&#x201d; of Sufi mystic poetry, Attar is best known for his epic poem <em>The Conference of the Birds</em>, a magnificent allegorical tale about the soul&#x2019;s search for meaning. The poem recounts the perilous journey of the world&#x2019;s birds to the faraway peaks of Mount Qaf&#x2015;a mythical mountain that wraps around the earth&#x2015;in search of their king, the mysterious Simorgh. Attar&#x2019;s beguiling anecdotes and humor intermingle the sublime with the mundane, the spiritual with the worldly, and the religious with the metaphysical. Reflecting the entire evolution of Sufi mystic tradition, <em>The Conference of the Birds</em> models the soul&#x2019;s escape from the mind&#x2019;s rational embrace.</p><p>Wolp� re-creates the intense beauty of the original Persian in contemporary English verse and poetic prose, capturing for the first time the grace and timeless wisdom of Attar&#x2019;s complete masterwork for modern readers.</p></p><p><strong>Sholeh Wolp�</strong> is an Iranian-American poet and writer. The author of more than ten books of poems, translations, and anthologies, she is the recipient of a PEN/Heim grant, the Midwest Book Award, and the Lois Roth Persian Translation prize, among others. Wolp� lives in Los Angeles.&#x201c;Attar&#x2019;s grand allegory for the journey of the soul as it seeks union with the divine has influenced countless artists, poets, mystics, and believers around the world. But never before has it been rendered in English with such beauty, elegance, and precision. Wolp�&#x2019;s translation of this epic is sure to be as timeless as the masterpiece itself.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Reza Aslan, author of <em>Zealot</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;I was struck by this accomplished translation, which moves the reader along from one stanza to the next in strong, compelling rhythms. I think what Sholeh Wolp� has done exceedingly well is to bring this medieval poem over into lively, contemporary English that feels absolutely right and not at all forced.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Edith Grossman, author of <em>Why Translation Matters</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;In Sholeh Wolp�&#x2019;s version, this sly, knowing Sufi classic will surprise and delight a new generation of readers.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Jack Miles, general editor of <em>The Norton Anthology of World Religions</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;As close to the original a reader can come in translation, and imbued with the same kind of revelation, it makes clear why Attar remained such a strong influence on Rumi. The reader travels, along with the poet&#x2019;s birds, to greater spiritual insight through transcendent verse.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Roger Sedarat, Queens College</strong></p><h2>Computers and Musical Style (Computer Music &amp; Digital Audio Series)</h2><p>The author demonstrates, through the use of computer, how he is able to replicate the musical styles of composers as diverse as Bach, Mozart and Prokofiev. He explains how the resultant compositions sound entirely new, yet somehow familiar.</p><p></p><h2>The Poet&#39;s Freedom: A Notebook on Making</h2><p><p>Why do we need new art? How free is the artist in making? And why is the artist, and particularly the poet, a figure of freedom in Western culture? The MacArthur Award&#x2013;winning poet and critic Susan Stewart ponders these questions in <i>The Poet&#x2019;s Freedom</i>. Through a series of evocative essays, she not only argues that freedom is necessary to making and is itself something made, but also shows how artists give rules to their practices and model a self-determination that might serve in other spheres of work.</p> <p>Stewart traces the ideas of freedom and making through insightful readings of an array of Western philosophers and poets&#x2014;Plato, Homer, Marx, Heidegger, Arendt, Dante, and Coleridge are among her key sources. She begins by considering the theme of making in the Hebrew Scriptures, examining their accountof a god who creates the world and leaves humans free to rearrange and reform the materials of nature. She goes on to follow the force of moods, sounds, rhythms, images, metrical rules, rhetorical traditions, the traps of the passions, and the nature of language in the cycle of making and remaking. Throughout the book she weaves the insight that the freedom to reverse any act of artistic making is as essential as the freedom to create.</p> <p> </p> <p>A book about the pleasures of making and thinking as means of life, <i>The Poet&#x2019;s Freedom</i> explores and celebrates the freedom of artists who, working under finite conditions, make considered choices and shape surprising consequences. This engaging and beautifully written notebook on making will attract anyone interested in the creation of art and literature.</p></p><p><b>Susan Stewart </b>is the Avalon Foundation University Professor in the Humanities and director of the Society of Fellows in the Liberal Arts at Princeton University.

However, the laws governing driving were for the most part yet to be written and the rules of the road were rudimentary to say the least. With a growing number of motorists in need of guidelines, <i>How to be a Good Motorist</i> provided all the information one needed to enjoy&#x2014;safely&#x2014;the open road, offering advice on how to handle such hazards as skidding, headlight glare, and livestock on the road.<br>Among the practical and unusual guidelines offered are what precautions one should take when another car approaches and which parts of a car&#x2019;s engine can be fixed in a pinch with emery paper, copper wire, and insulating tape. Some of the observations, like the cautionary note that, when driving, one ought to &#x201c;look on all other drivers as fools&#x201d; are sure to strike a chord with many motorists today. Others, like the suggestion that &#x201c;a good chauffeur will save his employer a great deal of expense&#x201d; evoke the style of a glamorous bygone era. The book covers such topics as unscrupulous secondhand car dealers, simple maintenance, women drivers, and &#x201c;dashboard delights.&#x201d; (Spoiler: For a well-equipped dashboard, don&#x2019;t forget the speedometer.) For those planning a longer journey, the book also advises on how to choose the most pleasant picnic site when on the road.<i><br>How to be a Good Motorist </i>is the perfect gift for the new driver or anyone who longs for a simpler time before rush-hour traffic reports and roundabouts.<br></p><p>&#x201c;As ever, the only way to learn to drive is by hitting the road&#x2015;and hoping that&#x2019;s all you hit. But that&#x2019;s never stopped the learning-by-reading lobby from writing guides on driving. <i>How to Be a Good Motorist,</i> abridged from a British book written by Harold Pemberton in 1923, gamely confronts automotive woes like how to handle a skid, a flat tire, and livestock grazing in the road.&#x201d; (<i>New York Times</i> 2014-06-01)</p><h2>Steve McCurry: A Life in Pictures (40 years of iconic McCurry photography including 100 unseen photos)</h2><p>The biggest and most comprehensive volume on Steve McCurry published to date and the final word on forty years of McCurry's incredible work.

Written entirely in the vernacular, these. classic satirical tales exposed the bigotry and hypocrisy of American life. The cheerful Tom Sawyer, the good natured Huck Finn, the independent Hank Morgan, and the well-meaning Tom Canty are quintessential Twain characters, full of life, verve, and a sense of justice they often felt was missing from the world around them.</p><p>Included are four of his greatest and most popular novels<i>: The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</i>, <i>The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</i>, <i>A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court</i>, and <i>The Prince and the Pauper</i>. They are the perfect introduction to the work of one of America's foremost talents.</p></p><p><b>Samuel Langhorne Clemens</b> (1835-1910), better known as Mark Twain, grew up in small town Missouri. As a young man, he was frequently on the move, working as a typesetter, as an apprentice to a riverboat captain, and eventually as a reporter during the Civil War. During this time, he developed a distinctive writing style. His publication of "The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County" in 1865 brought him national attention. His writing always possessed a touch of humor, sometimes gentle, sometimes bitter. In 1876, he turned his mind back to the pleasant days of his childhood as he wrote The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, both a classic humorous story of the exploits of a mischievous boy and an expos� of contemporary American society. Since then, his fame has only increased.</p><h2>A Mad, Bad, and Dangerous People?: England 1783-1846 (New Oxford History of England)</h2><p>This was a transformative period in English history. In 1783 the country was at one of the lowest points in its fortunes, having just lost its American colonies in warfare. By 1846 it was once more a great imperial nation, as well as the world's strongest power and dominant economy, having benefited from what has sometimes (if misleadingly) been called the 'first industrial revolution'. In the meantime it survived a decade of invasion fears, and emerged victorious from more than twenty years of 'war to the death' against Napoleonic France. But if Britain's external fortunes were in the ascendant, the situation at home remained fraught with peril. The country's population was growing at a rate not experienced by any comparable former society, and its manufacturing towns especially were mushrooming into filthy, disease-ridden, gin-sodden hell-holes, in turn provoking the phantasmagoria of a mad, bad, and dangerous people. It is no wonder that these years should have experienced the most prolonged period of social unrest since the seventeenth century, or that the elite should have been in constant fear of a French-style revolution in England. <br><br>The governing classes responded to these new challenges and by the mid-nineteenth century the seeds of a settled two-party system and of a more socially interventionist state were both in evidence, though it would have been far too soon to say at that stage whether those seeds would take permanent root. Another consequence of these tensions was the intellectual engagement with society, as for example in the Romantic Movement, a literary phenomenon that brought English culture to the forefront of European attention for the first time. At the same time the country experienced the great religious revival, loosely described under the heading 'evangelicalism'. Slowly but surely, the raffish and rakish style of eighteenth-century society, having reached a peak in the Regency, then succumbed to the new norms of respectability popularly known as 'Victorianism'.</p><p><br>Boyd Hilton is Reader in Modern British History the University of Cambridge and has been a Fellow of Trinity College since 1974.

But in the audience, we know little (and think less) about the enormous efforts of those involved in bringing an opera to life&#x2014;by the stagehands who shift scenery, the scenic artists who create beautiful backdrops, the electricians who focus the spotlights, and the stage manager who calls them and the singers to their places during the performance. The first comprehensive history of the behind-the-scenes world of opera production and staging, <i>From the Score to the Stage </i>follows the evolution of visual style and set design in continental Europe from its birth in the seventeenth century up to today.&nbsp;In clear, witty prose, Evan Baker covers all the major players and pieces involved in getting an opera onto the stage, from the stage director who creates the artistic concept for the production and guides the singers&#x2019; interpretation of their roles to the blocking of singers and placement of scenery. He concentrates on the people&#x2014;composers, librettists, designers, and technicians&#x2014;as well as the theaters and events that generated developments in opera production. Additional topics include the many difficulties in performing an opera, the functions of impresarios, and the business of music publishing. Delving into the absorbing and often neglected history of stage directing, theater architecture and technology, and scenic and lighting design, Baker nimbly links these technical aspects of opera to actual performances and performers, and the social context in which they appeared. Out of these details arise illuminating discussions of individual productions that cast new light on the operas of Wagner, Verdi, and others.&nbsp;Packed with nearly two hundred color illustrations, <i>From the Score to the Stage</i> is a revealing, always entertaining look at what happens before the curtain goes up on opening night at the opera house.</p><p><b>Evan Baker</b> is an independent scholar based in Los Angeles. He has worked as both a dramaturge and a stage director and lectures frequently to opera audiences.&#x201c;Engaging and lavishly illustrated.&#x201d;&nbsp; (<i>New York Times</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;To write the history of opera production, not only must one know the repertory well, but one needs to understand the extraordinary work of the many people involved backstage who make an operatic spectacle function. Few people are as capable of writing such a history as Evan Baker, who has worked as a dramaturge and stage director for decades. Baker understands the changes that have accompanied operatic spectacles in modern times, as nonmusical influences have become an increasingly prominent aspect of the performance. In his new book, <i>From the Score to the Stage,</i> he follows these changes from the seventeenth century to the present. For the history of directing, stagecraft, and lighting in particular, Baker is superb.&#x201d; (<i>New York Review of Books</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Baker covers all the major players and pieces involved in getting an opera onto the stage, from the stage director who creates the artistic concept for the production and guides the singers&#x2019; interpretation of their roles to the blocking of singers and placement of scenery.&nbsp; . . .

To be sure, much of the operatic past is irrevocably lost. But <i>From the Score to the Stage</i> brings so much of it to life that an opera-lover can only be grateful.&#x201d;<br> (<i>Opera News</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Anyone associated with the production and planning of opera, not to mention also audiences and students of theater and cinema, will want to own <i>From the Score to the Stage</i>, which, for its comprehensive scope and sheer panache, has no competitor. Whether read cover to cover or used as an easy-to-navigate reference on particular topics, it is the indispensable single-source guide to the opera stage.&#x201d;<br> (Rodney Punt <i>Huffington Post</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;The illustrations are fascinating and occasionally quite humorous. . . . Baker&#x2019;s accompanying text, which is never pedantic, will be enjoyable for both opera scholars and neophytes seeking more background on the genre. As a general overview of Continental opera stage production, this unequaled volume will be an important addition to any opera library. . . . Essential.&#x201d; (<i>Choice</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;<i>From the Score to the Stage</i> is the best study of its kind: scholarly, entertaining, and comprehensive in its grasp of this wonderful subject. . . .

Standard military accounts tend to start with the Graeco-Persian wars, laying undue emphasis on the preeminence of Greek heavy infantry. But, as this strikingly original and entertaining book shows, the origins of war can be traced back not to the Iron Age, or even to the Bronze Age, but to the emergence of settled life itself nearly 10,000 years ago. The military revolution that occurred then&#x2014;the invention of major new weapons, the massive fortifications, the creation of strategy and tactics&#x2014;ultimately gave rise to the great war machines of ancient Egypt, Assyria, and Persia that dominated the Near East until the time of Alexander the Great.It is Arther Ferrill's thesis that in the period before Alexander there were two independent lines of military development&#x2014;a Near Eastern one culminating in the expert integration of cavalry, skirmishers, and light infantry and a Greek one based on heavy infantry. When Philip and Alexander blended the two traditions in their crack Macedonian army, the result was a style of warfare that continued, despite technological changes, down to Napoleon.This newly revised edition presents detailed and copiously illustrated accounts of all the major battles on land and sea up to the fourth century b.c., analyzes weapons from the sling to the catapult, and discusses ancient strategy and tactics, making this a book for armchair historians everywhere.</p><p>Arther Ferrill</p><h2>Construction Contracting, 6th Edition</h2><p>After thirty years, it&#x2019;s still the reference professionals and students turn to...

He raised the question of why women were excluded and provided answers based not on sex but on social conditioning, education, and the prejudices of their more powerful oppressors. His declamation, disseminated through the printing press, illustrated the power of that new medium, soon to be used to generate a larger reformation of religion.</p></p><p><br><b>Margaret L.

Combining legal, literary, and book history approaches, <i>Slavery on Trial</i> provides a refreshing alternative to the official perspectives offered by the nation's founding documents, legal treatises, statutes, and judicial decisions.

The biblical story of the flood crystalizes--in its terrifying, dramatic simplicity--the universally recognized concept of divine punishment. For millennia human civilizations have relied on such beliefs to create moral order. People who commit crimes or other bad deeds, we are told, will suffer retribution, while rewards--abstract or material--await those who do good. This simple but powerful idea has long served to deter self-interest and achieve remarkable levels of cooperation. Indeed, as all societies seem to have found, these beliefs are so good at promoting cooperation that they may have been favored by natural selection. Today, while secularism and unbelief are at an all-time high, the willingness to believe in some kind of payback or karma remains nearly universal. Even atheists often feel they are being monitored and judged. We find ourselves imagining what our parents, spouse, or boss would think of our thoughts and actions, even if they are miles away and will never find out. We talk of eyes burning into the backs of our heads, the walls listening, a sense that someone or something is out there, observing our every move, aware of our thoughts and intentions.<br><br><em>God Is Watching You</em> is an exploration of this belief as it has developed over time and how it has shaped the course of human evolution. Dominic Johnson explores such questions as: Was a belief in supernatural consequences instrumental in the origins of human societies? How has it affected the way human society has changed, how we live today, and how we will live in the future? Does it expand or limit the potential for local, regional and global cooperation? How will the current decline in religious belief (at least in many western countries) affect our ability to live together? And what, if anything, will temper self-interest and promote cooperation if religion declines? In short, do we still need God?<br><br>Drawing on new research from anthropology, evolutionary biology, experimental psychology, and neuroscience, Johnson presents a new theory of supernatural punishment that offers fresh insight into the origins and evolution of not only religion, but also human cooperation and society. He shows that belief in supernatural reward and punishment is no quirk of western or Christian culture, but a ubiquitous part of human nature that spans geographical regions, cultures, and human history.<br></p><p><br><strong>Dominic Johnson</strong> received a D.Phil. from Oxford University in evolutionary biology, and a Ph.D. from Geneva University in political science. Drawing on both disciplines, he is interested in how new research on evolution and human nature is challenging traditional understandings of international relations, conflict, cooperation and religion. He is the author of numerous scientific journal articles, as well as <em>Overconfidence and War: The Havoc and Glory of Positive Illusions</em> (2004) and, with Dominic Tierney, <em>Failing to Win: Perceptions of Victory and Defeat in International Politics</em> (2006).

Highly recommended [for] lower-division undergraduates through faculty." --<em>CHOICE</em><p></p><br>"Think God is good? Think again. In his stunning new book, <em>God Is Watching You</em>, Johnson pulls back the curtain on tens of thousands of years of human evolution to reveal how religion's enduring success lies almost entirely in our belief in divine wrath and an unforgiving universe. And before you say, 'speak for yourself,' read this book. As it turns out, even atheists aren't immune." --Jesse Bering, author of <em>The Belief Instinct</em><p></p><br>"According to Dominic Johnson, religion comes naturally to us because it is a biological adaptation. But if so, could we--and should we--seek to replace religion with secular institutions that serve similar functions? This lucid and highly entertaining book offers some surprising answers that will stimulate debate for years to come." --Harvey Whitehouse, author of <em>Modes of Religiosity</em><p></p><br>"<em>God Is Watching You</em> is a remarkable book. Dominic Johnson brings his unique multidisciplinary expertise to every page and I simply marvel at the breadth, clarity, and acuity of his exposition. Johnson not only offers a novel and strongly supported explanation of how religion evolved, but crucially, he astutely explores the important implications of this evolutionary legacy for our world today." --Richard Sosis, James Barnett Professor of Humanistic Anthropology, University of Connecticut<p></p><br>"In a world where creationists deny evolution and atheists decry belief in God, Dominic Johnson provides a lot of answers by explaining belief in gods as an evolutionary adaptation." --David Sloan Wilson, author of <em>Darwin's Cathedral and Does Altruism Exist?</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Hypnosis and Behavioral Medicine</h2><p>This important volume applies hypnotic principles to the specific challenges of behavioral medicine.

Hogarth&#x2019;s stature in his own time suggests the importance of his attempt to systematize and theorize his own artistic practice. What he proposes is an aesthetics of the middle range, subordinating both the Beautiful and the Sublime to the everyday world of human choice and contingency&#x2015;essentially the world of Hogarth&#x2019;s own modern moral subjects, his engraved works.<br></p><p><p>English artist William Hogarth (1697&#x2013;1764) is most famous for his satirical caricatures and moral paintings, the forerunners of cartoons.

Is it realistic to think of anarchist ideas ever forming the basis for social life itself? These questions are widely being asked again today in response to the forces of economic globalization. The framework for such discussions was perhaps given its most memorable shape, however,&nbsp;in George Woodcock's classic study of anarchism&#x2014;now widely recognized as the most significant twentieth-century overview of the subject.&nbsp; </p><br><br><p>Woodcock surveys all of the major figures that shaped anarchist thought, from Godwin and Proudhon to Bakunin, Goldman, and Kropotkin, and looks as well at the long-term prospects for anarchism and anarchist thought. In Woodcock's view "pure" anarchism&#x2014;characterized by "the loose and flexible affinity group which needs no formal organization"&#x2014;was incompatible with mass movements that require stable organizations, that are forced to make compromises in the face of changing circumstances, and that need to maintain the allegiance of a wide range of supporters. Yet Woodcock continued to cherish anarchist ideals; as he said in a 1990 interview, "I think anarchism and its teachings of decentralization, of the coordination of rural and industrial societies, and of mutual aid as the foundation of any viable society, have lessons that in the present are especially applicable to industrial societies."</p><br><br><p>This classic work of intellectual history and political theory (first published in the 1960s, revised in 1986) is now available exclusively from UTP Higher Education.</p></p><p><p><b>George Woodcock</b> (1912-1995), internationally acclaimed intellectual historian and man of letters, was the author of dozens of books, including the classic biography <i>Gabriel Dumont: The Metis Chief and His Lost World</i> and the Governor-General's Award-winning <i>George Orwell: The Crystal Spirit</i>.</p><p>Woodcock's thoughtful appraisals, careful research, and graceful writing skillfully demonstrate the importance of anarchism as a historical movement. At the same time, his compassion and generosity of spirit make plain the relevance of anarchism to our own age of capital, empire, and the surveillance state. His book remains the essential introduction to the classical anarchist thinkers.</p> (Mark Leier, Director, Centre for Labour Studies, Simon Fraser University)</p><h2>Introduction to Criminal Justice</h2><p><i>Introduction to Criminal Justice</i> is the perfect text for students interested in pursuing a career in criminal justice and for those who simply want to learn more about the criminal justice system.

Includes coverage of advanced systems like UMTS, CDMA-2000, and HIPERLAN2, as well as an extensive bibliography. DLC: Wireless communication systems.</p><p>"Wideband" wireless communications are those where the time dispersion, i.e. the existence of echoes with different delays, plays a marked role. Practically all existing and future wireless systems are wideband in this sense, so that the treatment of time dispersion is one of the most important aspects of wireless engineering. <p>However, a range of different methods have been developed to deal with time dispersion: unequalized systems, equalizers for TDMA systems, Rake receivers for CDMA systems, and multicarrier modulation OFDM. While they all have the same aim, the actual methods are quite different. We thus agreed that a team of authors, each being a specialist in one of the above-mentioned four fields, was the only way to treat those different methods at a high level. </p><p>In all these different fields, there has been intensive research, and thus there is a bewildering amount of different methods and papers. One main purpose of this book is to bring order into that, and present the different methods in a systematic way. To give but one example, Part III (equalizers), presents a new classification of equalizer structures that is based on the question of whether the channel impulse response is measured, estimated, or averaged over. </p><p>Thus, work started three years ago, with countless hours of sifting through the literature, and continued until the production of the book in the fall of 2000. We also added an introductory part, which contains some key data describing the air interface of existing systems. However, our approach is not to give a "recipe" for the simulation of existing systems. Rather, we are concentrating on the underlying science, which can then be applied to both existing and future systems. We hope to have succeeded in producing a volume that allows the interested reader to extract a lot of relevant information, to help him decide what approaches and methods to use in the future, and which provides a useful research reference.</p>Outline <p> After the introductory focus in this part, the rest of this book covers (i) unequalized systems, (ii) equalizers, (iii) OFDM, and (iv) Rake receivers. All these four parts are self-contained, so they can be read in arbitrary sequence. </p><p> PART II - UNEQUALIZED SYSTEMS by Molisch discusses those systems at the boundary between wideband and narrowband where the time dispersion is smaller, but not much smaller, than the symbol duration (slightly time-dispersive systems) and do not contain equalizers. Typically, those systems were originally designed as true narrowband systems, where it later turned out that under some circumstances time dispersion can play a role, or where equalizers were simply too expensive. </p><p> After a brief introduction, Chapter 7 gives a generic system description for both transmitter and receiver. The most important modulation formats, namely, phase-shift keying, quadrature amplitude modulation, and continuous-phase frequency shift keying are described mathematically, together with the standard detection methods (coherent, differentially coherent, and incoherent). </p><p> Chapter 8 then describes various mathematical methods for computing the bit error probability (BER) of unequalized systems under the influence of time-dispersive signals. Although most textbooks on mobile radio describe the standard approach for flat-fading, namely, first computing the BER for AWGN channels and then averaging over the distribution of channel attenuation, this approach is no longer possible for time-dispersive channels. Methods that circumvent these problems are, e.g., based on certain properties of quadratic forms of Gaussian variables, probability density functions of the angles between Gauss-distributed vectors, or the group delay distributions of the channel. Unfortunately, none of these can be considered to be a master approach that is optimum for all possible cases. Methods based on Gaussian variables are usually the simplest but always require the channel to be Rayleigh- or Rice-fading, and encounter problems, e.g., in Nakagami channels. Within this group, the method based on quadratic forms can most easily include arbitrary time dispersion but cannot easily be extended to multilevel modulation formats, e.g., A -ary PSK, which can be better treated by pdfs of Gaussian vectors or the two-path equivalent matrix method. Chapter 8 describes the different methods in sufficient detail for the reader to judge what is needed to solve a specific problem, but details are covered only in a few examples. </p><p> Closed-form equations and figures of the performance of standard systems are the contents of Chapter 9. The influence of modulation format, delay spread, shape of the power delay profile, sampling instant, and other parameters are presented. </p><p> In Chapter 10, the author describes special modulation formats and receiver structures that are used for the reduction of ISI-induced errors (error floor). Some modulation formats try to actually exploit the time dispersion and thus approach the performance of an equalized system in a time-dispersive environment. The penalty paid for this approach lies in a higher bandwidth requirement, which precludes these formats from application in cellular systems, but the technique might be interesting for wireless LANs and cordless applications. </p><p> Some receiver structures, on the other hand, try just to reduce the error floor by eliminating the ISI before detection, thus making the performance comparable to a true flat-fading channel. These stay within the framework of standard modulation formats and thus usually have only a penalty in the form of a slightly more complex receiver structure (but still much simpler than an equalizer). A technique that also has these properties is adaptive sampling, more exactly, the adaptive choice of the sampling instant according to the channel constellation. Adaptive sampling is described in Chapter 11. </p><p> Chapter 12 describes antenna diversity. Although antenna diversity is usually known to reduce noise-induced errors, it was also shown to be an effective countermeasure for ISI-induced errors. After a description of the different ways to combine the diversity signals, the mathematical methods of Chapter 8 are modified to include the diversity effects. Those methods are useful not only for conventional multidimensional diversity, but also for the performance of Rake receivers, since these use the time-delayed echoes of the original signal as diversity signals that are combined with maximum-ratio combining. Subsequently, the performance with the diversity antennas is presented in some examples. A summary (Chapter 13) concludes this part. </p><p> PART III - EQUALIZERS by Vitetta, Hart, Mammela, and Taylor focuses on the equalization techniques for single-carrier, unspread digital signals transmitted over multipath fading channels and is organized as described below. </p><p> Some preliminary topics are presented in Chapter 14, where the mathematical models of the transmitted signal and of the wireless channel are illustrated. An optimal receiver must not discard useful information present in the continuous time received signal; digital processing, however, is an inevitable requirement of any modern receiver. Therefore, filtering and discretizing of the received signal are discussed. Notations for the various scalar and matrix quantities needed in the remainder of the Part are given; in particular, matrix representations for the received signal samples are provided to simplify the derivation of equalization algorithms. Finally, reduced complexity channel models, i.e., parsimonious representations or parameterizations of the channel impulse response, are introduced to simplify the channel estimation problem and the equalizer design. In particular, the authors focus on the Karhunen-Loeve expansion, on the complex exponential parameterization, and on the power series models. </p><p> Any equalization algorithm processes the received signal, producing a set of real quantities, known as metrics, that are evaluated by the receiver to make decisions on the transmitted data. In Chapter 15 we derive, interpret and analyze the performance of the metrics computed by optimal detectors under the assumption that the CIR (or some equivalent quantity) is known, estimated, or averaged over for the doubly selective wireless channel and its special cases: the frequency-flat and frequency-selective channels. Both the maximum likelihood (ML) and maximum a posteriori (MAP) methods are discussed as optimality criteria, and their application to bits, symbols and sequences of symbols is illustrated. In particular MAP bit detectors (MAPBDs), MAP symbol detectors (MAPSDs) and ML sequence detectors (MLSDs) are considered. In addition, performance bounds for both the ML and MAP detectors are provided; they represent useful tool to assess their error performance in some situations. </p><p> In Chapter 16, we describe various equalization algorithms corresponding to different ways of implementing the computation of the derived metrics, ranging from optimal to highly suboptimal. Again the primary division into sections is related to how the CIR is treated. Within each section, the structure, complexity, and performance measures of each type of equalizer are described. In particular, in Section 16.1 we begin by assuming that the CIR is known exactly a priori, and we derive five important classes of equalizers: MLSDs, MAPSDs and MAPBDs, reduced complexity sequence detectors, decision feedback equalizers (DFEs), and linear equalizers (LEs). The aim of Section 16.2 is twofold. First, we show some mathematical tools for channel estimation and we discuss blind equalization techniques. Secondly, we illustrate equalization techniques incorporating channel estimation strategies, like adaptive MLSDs and adaptive MAPBD/MAPSDs. Adaptive LEs and DFEs and pilot-based detection techniques for frequency-flat fading channels are also considered. Equalization when the CIR is averaged-over is investigated in Section 16.3. MLSDs and MAPSDs are developed and are related to their adaptive counterparts. Finally, various equalization/detection strategies for FF fading channels are illustrated.</p><p></p><p> PART IV - OFDM by May and Rohling describes orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDM), also known as multicarrier modulation. Chapter 17 introduces OFDM and describes its historical evolution. Chapter 18 describes the basic transmission/reception technique, both in a time-continuous formulation that is intuitively appealing and in a time-discrete formulation that illuminates the important relation to discrete Fourier transforms. The shaping of the basic pulses is discussed. In a conventional system, rectangular pulses are used as a basis for constructing the total signal, but this might not be optimum in dispersive channels. Chapter 19 then treats frame, timing, and carrier frequency synchronization. </p><p> Chapters 20 and 21 are devoted to modulation and demodulation. Many aspects are identical to those of single-carrier systems, but there are also some specific points that are unique to OFDM systems.

It dealt with a woman, one greater, more dangerous than Cleopatra, thirty-nine times as alluring as sunlight on a gold eagle, and about as elusive. <br><br>She was a Peacock, said the item, which was not ill-written &#x2013; a slinky female with electrifying green eyes and red hair, dressed in clinging green-and-blue-silk, and she was very much observed as she moved languorously through the streets of Brooklyn. A Somebody &#x2013; but who? <br><br>The city editor scratched his head and gave the item to Karl.<br> <br>&#x201c;Find out about her,'' he suggested.<br> <br>&#x201c;Better put a new guy on,'' said Karl. "Get the fresh angle. I got that Kinney case to look after today. What about Garvey?''<br> <br>&#x201c;All right,'' said the city editor, and selected a fresh piece of gum. <br><br>Garvey was duly impressed when Karl hove to alongside his desk and flung his leg after the item onto it, for Karl was the Star. <br><br>Rather a mysterious person in a way, was Karl. His residence was an inviolable secret. He was known to have accumulated money, despite the fact that he was a newspaperman. It was also known that he had married. <br><br>Otherwise, he was an emergency man &#x2013; a first-rate reporter. When someone thought best to commit suicide and leave a little malicious note to a wife who raved three steps into the bathroom and three into the kitchen, hiccuping "Oh, my God!'' with each step, it got into Karl's typewriter &#x2013; and there was the birth of a front-page story.<br> <br>&#x201c;So you're to look her up,'' said Karl. She's dashed beautiful, has cat eyes and Leslie Carter hair &#x2013; a loose-jointed, ball-bearing Clytie, rigged out with acomplexion like creamed coffee stood overnight. They say she claws more men into her hair than any siren living or dead.''<br> <br>"You've seen her?'' breathed Garvey, staring. <br><br>Karl nodded briefly.<br> <br>"Why don't you get her, then?''<br> <br>&#x201c;There are two things,'' said Karl judicially, at which I am no good. One is subtraction, and the other is attraction. Go to it, son. The assignment is yours.'' <br><br>He strolled away, but not too late to see Garvey swelling visibly at the implied compliment and caressing his beautiful, lyric tie. <br><br>Garvey didn't altogether like the assignment, nonetheless. There was Lilac Jane, you see. He had a date with her for that very night, and Lilac Jane was exceedingly desirable. <br><br>He was at that age when devotion to one female of the species makes dalliance with any others nothing short of treason. <br><br>But &#x2013; he had been allotted this work because of his fascina�tions for slinky green sirens! Garvey fingered the tie again and withdrew his lavender scented handkerchief airily, as an altar-boy swings a censer. <br><br>At the door he turned under the light and pushed back his cuff, and his fellow workers groaned. It was seven by his wristwatch. <br><br>Outside he paused on the corner near the chophouse. He looked up and down the gloomy street with its wilted florist-window displays and its spattering of gray house fronts, wishing there were someone with him who could be told of his feeling of competence in a world of competent men. <br><br>His eyes on the pavement, lost in perfervid dreams of Lilac Jane, he wandered on. The roaring of the bridge traffic disturbed him not, nor the shouts of bargemen through the dusk on the waterfront. <br><br>At last through the roseate visions loomed something green. <br><br>Shoes! Tiny shoes, trim and immaculate; above them a glimpse of thin, green stockings on trimmer ankles. <br><br>There was a tinkle of laughter, and Garvey came to himself, red and perspiring, and raised his eyes past the slim, green-clad body to the eyes of the Peacock. <br>The Terrible Peacock <br><br>It was she beyond question. Her hair was terribly red, even in the darkness, and it gleamed a full eight inches above her forehead, piled higher than any hair Garvey had ever seen. The moon shone through it like butter through mosquito netting. <br><br>Her neck was long and white, her lips were redder than her hair, and her green eyes, with the close-fitting, silken dress, that undulated like troubled, weed-filled water as she moved, com�pleted the whole daring creation. The powers that be had gone in for poster effects when they made the Peacock. <br><br>She was handsome beyond belief, and she was amused at Garvey. Her silvery laugh tinkled out again as he stared at her, his pulse ahundred in the shade. <br><br>He tried to convince himself that this physiological effect was due to his newspaper instinct, but it is to be conjectured that Lilac Jane would have had her opinion of the Peacock had she been present.<br> <br>"Well, young man?'' she demanded, the wonderful eyes getting in their deadly work. <br><br>&#x201c;I &#x2013; I'm sorry &#x2013; I didn't mean &#x2013;" Garvey floundered hopelessly, but he did not try to escape. <br><br>&#x201c;You were handing me bouquets by staring like that? That what you're trying to say?'' <br><br>She laughed again, glided up to him and took his arm. "I like you, young man,'' she said.<br> <br>&#x201c;My nun-name is Garvey, and I'm on the &#x2013; the Argus.'' <br><br>She started at that and looked at him sharply. &#x201c;A reporter!'' <br><br>But her tinkly laugh rang out again, and they walked on.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, why not?'' she said gaily. <br><br>Then, with entire unexpectedness: &#x201c;Do you tango?'' <br><br>Garvey nodded dumbly, struggling to find his tongue.<br><br>&#x201c;I love it!'' declared the Peacock, taking a step or two of the dance beside him. "Want to take me somewheres so we can have a turn or two?'' <br><br>Garvey swallowed hard and mentioned a well-known resort.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mercy!'' cried the green-eyed siren, turning shocked orbs upon him. "I don't drink! Let's go to a tearoom &#x2013; Poiret's.'' She called it Poyrett's.'' <br><br>Garvey suffered himself to be led to the slaughter, and as they went she chattered lightly. He drew out his handkerchief and dabbed gently at his temples.<br><br>&#x201c;Gracious!'' she drawled. You smell like an epidemic of swooning women.'' <br><br>Garvey was hurt, but deep within himself he decided suddenly that scent was out of place on a masculine cold-assuager. <br><br>They turned into abrightly lighted establishment where there were already a few girls and fewer men. <br><br>They found a table, and she ordered some tea and cakes, pressing her escort not to be bashful as far as himself was concerned. Garvey ordered obediently and lavishly. <br><br>Presently the music struck up, and he swung her out on the floor and into the fascinating dance. <br><br>Now, Garvey was really some dancer. But the Peacock! <br><br>She was light and sinuous as a wreath of green mist, yet solid bone and muscle in his arms. <br><br>She was the very poetry of motion, the spirit of the dance, the essence of grace and beauty. <br><br>And when the music stopped, Garvey could have cried with vexation, though he was considerably winded. <br><br>But the Peacock was not troubled at all. Indeed, she had talked on through all the dance. <br><br>Garvey had capitulated long ago. Lilac Jane? Bah! What were a thousand Lilac Janes to this glorious creature, this Venus Anadyomene &#x2013; Aphrodite of the Sea-Foam? <br><br>In the bright light of the tearoom her green eyes were greener, her red hair redder, her white throat whiter. He would have given a Texas ranch for her, with the cattle thrown in. <br><br>He tried to tell her something of this, and she laughed delight�fully. <br><br>&#x201c;What is it about me that makes men go mad over me?'' she demanded, dreamily sipping her tea.<br> <br>&#x201c;Do they?'' He winced.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, shamelessly. They drop their jaws, propriety, and any bundles they may be carrying. Why?''<br> <br>&#x201c;It's the most natural thing in the world. You have hair and eyes that few women have, and a man desires the rare.'' He was getting eloquent. <br><br>But &#x2013; I'm not at all pretty &#x2013; thinness isn't attractive, is it?'' <br><br>&#x201c;It is, in you,'' he said simply. The fact that he could say it simply was very bad indeed for Lilac Jane. <br><br>She dimpled at him and arose abruptly. &#x201c;Now I've got to vanish. Oh, Lily!'' <br><br>A girl, undeniably pretty, but just an ordinary girl, crossed over.<br> <br>&#x201c;This is Mr. &#x2013; er &#x2013; Garvey, Miss Jones. Keep him amused, will you? He dances very nicely.'' And as he struggled to his feet, attempting a protest: Oh, I'm coming back again,'' and she was gone. <br><br>Garvey tried to think of some excuse to escape from the partner thus unceremoniously thrust upon him, but the girl blocked his feeble efforts by rising expectantly as the strains of "Too Much Mustard'' floated on the ambient atmosphere. <br><br>There was nothing for it but to make good. And, after all, she was a nice dancer. He found himself asking what she would have at the end of the dance. <br><br>Anyhow, he reflected, he had still his assignment to cover. The Peacock was still as great a mystery as ever &#x2013; more of a mystery. But she had said that she would return. So he waited and danced and ate and treated. <br><br>Half an hour later the Peacock did return &#x2013; with another man. <br><br>To Garvey everything turned suddenly light purple. That was the result of his being green with jealousy and seeing red at the same time. <br><br>The newest victim of her lures (for such even Garvey recog�nized him to be) was an elderly business man, inclined to corpulency, with a free and roving eye. Garvey hated him with a bitter hatred. <br><br>The Peacock danced once with him, then abandoned him, gasping fishily, to another girl's tender mercies. <br><br>She stopped briefly at Garvey's table, gave him a smile and a whispered: Here, tomorrow night,'' and vanished in a swirl of green silk &#x2013; probably in search of more captives. <br><br>Garvey put in a bad night and a worse next day. Who was she? What was her little game? What would happen tomorrow night? <br><br>He didn't care. Lilac Jane was definitely deposed in favor of a green goddess whose lure quite possibly spelled destruction. <br><br>But he didn't care. <br><br>He told the city editor that the Peacock story would be available next day, and added the mental reservation, "If I haven't resigned.'' And he mooned through the work in a trance that made for serious errors in his &#x201c;copy.'' <br><br>Yet he had no illusions about it, save an undefined and noble impulse to "rescue the Peacock from her degrading surroundings.'' <br><br>Somehow the phrase didn't quite apply, though. <br><br>Once he thought of Lilac Jane, with her warm, normal, womanly arms stretched out to him. He took her picture from his pocket and compared it with the mental picture he carried of the Peacock, then put the photograph back, face outward. <br><br>Thus Lilac Jane's flags were struck. <br><br>Directly afterward the brazen office-boy communicated to him in strident tones that a "skoit" wanted him on the phone. <br><br>For a second he thought of the Peacock; but no, Lilac Jane was due to call. Whereupon he fled ignominiously. <br><br>It may be deduced that he had not forgotten Lilac Jane after all, merely misplaced her. <br><br>Garvey fell into the elevator, the cosmic tail of the Peacock filling his existence. He threw quoits with the god of agreater wisdom, and came out of his reverie and the elevator with a pair of jet earrings dancing before him. They were the earrings of Lilac Jane. <br><br>But beneath them, as the periods beneath double exclamation points, floated a pair of green boots. <br><br>Moodily he ate, moodily he went to his room &#x2013; apartment, I beg his pardon. And at six o'clock he was ready for eight. <br><br>He took out his watch and wound it until the hands quivered and it made noises inside as though it were in pain. <br><br>He stood before the mirror and motioned at his Adam's apple, prodding the lyric tie into shape and stretching his neck the while until it seemed about to snap and leave a blank space between his chin and his collar button. <br><br>A man in love ceases mentally. All his energy is devoted to his outward appearance. <br><br>If Napoleon had been in love while on the field of Austerlitz, he would not have rejoiced in his heart, but in his surtout and small clothes. <br><br>If Wellington had been so afflicted during the battle of Waterloo, the result might have been different. <br><br>Therefore, when Garvey was finally attired, he was like unto the lilies of the field that toil not, neither do they spin. He glanced at his watch when all was at last perfect, and all but sat down suddenly. It was midnight! <br><br>But then he saw that the poor watch was travelling at the rate of a mile a minute, trying to make up for that last winding. The alarm clock said seven-thirty. <br><br>Whereupon Garvey achieved the somewhat difficult feat of descending the stairs without bending his knees. Spoil the crease in his trousers? Never! <br><br>And shortly thereafter he was at the tango tearoom, looking around eagerly for the Peacock, his heart pounding harder than his watch. <br><br>The place was crowded, and the dancers were already busy to the sprightly strains of &#x201c;Stop at Chattanooga.'' <br><br>For a space he looked in vain. Then his cardiac engine missed a stroke. <br><br>There she was &#x2013; seated at a table in the far corner. <br><br>As fast as he reasonably could without danger to his immacu�lateness, Garvey headed Her-ward. <br><br>Yes, it was undoubtedly the Peacock. She was leaning her elbows on the table and talking earnestly &#x2013; talking to &#x2013; Karl! <br><br>Garvey was abreast of the table by now. He must have made some sort of anoise, for they both looked up. <br><br>The Peacock smiled sweetly, with a touch of defiance. Karl grinned amiably, with a touch of sheepishness. And both said: &#x201c;Hello!'' <br><br>Then said Karl: "Old man, allow me to present you to &#x2013; my wife.'' <br><br>Garvey choked and sat down speechless. <br><br>&#x201c;Might as well 'fess it,'' said Karl. "Only please remember that the idea was solely mine.'' It was not!'' said the Peacock sharply. &#x201c;You wouldn't hear of it when I suggested it.'' <br><br>&#x201c;Well, anyhow, I have all my money invested in this tearoom. But business has been mighty dull; it looked like bankruptcy. <br><br>&#x201c;Then Mrs. Karl here &#x2013; she was La Dancerita before she fell for me, you see, and &#x2013; well, she's been drumming up patronage.'' <br><br>&#x201c;It was fun!'' declared La Dancerita-that-was.

Key Debates in Anthropology collects together the first six of these debates, spanning the period from 1988 to 1993. For each debate there are four principal speakers: one to propose the motion, another to oppose it, and two seconders. These debates give unprecedented insight into the process of anthropological theory in the making, as the many contributors both engage with each other&#39;s positions and respond to wider intellectual currents of the time. The first debate addresses the disciplinary character of social anthropology: can it be regarded as a science, and if so, is it able to establish general propositions about human culture and social life? The second examines the concept of society, in relation to such terms as individual, community, nation and state. In the third debate the spotlight is turned on the concept of culture, and on the role of culture in people&#39;s perception of their environments. The fourth debate focuses on the place of language in the formation of culture, highlighting the problematic distinction between verbal and non-verbal communication. The fifth takes up the question of how we view the past in relation to the present, touching on the difference between history and memory. Finally, in the sixth debate, the concern is with the cross-cultural applicability of the concept of aesthetics. Can there be an anthropology of aesthetics, or is the term so wedded to Western standards of evaluation as to make any such endeavour hopelessly ethnocentric?<strong>Tim Ingold</strong> is the Max Gluckman Professor of Social Anthropology at the University of Manchester</p><h2>Mimesis as Make-Believe: On the Foundations of the Representational Arts</h2><p><p> Representations--in visual arts and in fiction--play an important part in our lives and culture. Kendall Walton presents here a theory of the nature of representation, which illuminates its many varieties and goes a long way toward explaining its importance. </p><p> Drawing analogies to children's make believe activities, Walton constructs a theory that addresses a broad range of issues: the distinction between fiction and nonfiction, how depiction differs from description, the notion of points of view in the arts, and what it means for one work to be more "realistic" than another. He explores the relation between appreciation and criticism, the character of emotional reactions to literary and visual representations, and what it means to be caught up emotionally in imaginary events. </p><p> Walton's theory also provides solutions to the thorny philosophical problems of the existence--or ontological standing--of fictitious beings, and the meaning of statements referring to them. And it leads to striking insights concerning imagination, dreams, nonliteral uses of language, and the status of legends and myths. </p><p> Throughout Walton applies his theoretical perspective to particular cases; his analysis is illustrated by a rich array of examples drawn from literature, painting, sculpture, theater, and film. <i>Mimesis as Make-Believe</i> is important reading for everyone interested in the workings of representational art. </p></p><p><b>Kendall L. Watson</b> is Professor of Philosophy at the University of Michigan.Kendall Walton&#39;s book is one of the few genuinely distinguished contributions to aesthetic theory published in the last decade or two. It will be essential reading for anyone in the field and contains much that will be of great interest to scholars and critics of the arts.

These inferences concern underlying image and scene structure as well as solutions to such problems as image reconstruction, image segmentation, 3D vision, and object labeling. It offers key findings and state-of-the-art research on both algorithms and applications.</p><p>After an introduction to the fundamental concepts used in MRFs, the book reviews some of the main algorithms for performing inference with MRFs; presents successful applications of MRFs, including segmentation, super-resolution, and image restoration, along with a comparison of various optimization methods; discusses advanced algorithmic topics; addresses limitations of the strong locality assumptions in the MRFs discussed in earlier chapters; and showcases applications that use MRFs in more complex ways, as components in bigger systems or with multiterm energy functions. The book will be an essential guide to current research on these powerful mathematical tools.</p></p><p>Andrew Blake is Managing Director of Microsoft Research Cambridge (UK), where he has led the Computer Vision Research Group since 1999.</p><h2>ECON Macro (Engaging 4LTR Press Titles for Economics)</h2><p>Created through a &#34;student-tested, faculty-approved&#34; review process with numerous students and faculty, ECON: MACRO, 3E is an engaging, accessible solution designed to accommodate the diverse lifestyles of today&#39;s learners without sacrificing content.

And this is the question at the heart of Katherine Benton-Cohen&#x2019;s provocative history, which ties that seemingly remote corner of the country to one of America&#x2019;s central concerns: the historical creation of racial boundaries.</p><p>It was in Cochise County that the Earps and Clantons fought, Geronimo surrendered, and Wheeler led the infamous Bisbee Deportation, and it is where private militias patrol for undocumented migrants today. These dramatic events animate the rich story of the Arizona borderlands, where people of nearly every nationality&#x2015;drawn by &#x201c;free&#x201d; land or by jobs in the copper mines&#x2015;grappled with questions of race and national identity. Benton-Cohen explores the daily lives and shifting racial boundaries between groups as disparate as Apache resistance fighters, Chinese merchants, Mexican-American homesteaders, Midwestern dry farmers, Mormon polygamists, Serbian miners, New York mine managers, and Anglo women reformers.</p><p>Racial categories once blurry grew sharper as industrial mining dominated the region. Ideas about home, family, work and wages, manhood and womanhood all shaped how people thought about race. Mexicans were legally white, but were they suitable marriage partners for &#x201c;Americans&#x201d;? Why were Italian miners described as living &#x201c;as no white man can&#x201d;? By showing the multiple possibilities for racial meanings in America, Benton-Cohen&#x2019;s insightful and informative work challenges our assumptions about race and national identity.</p></p><p>Katherine Benton-Cohen is Associate Professor of History at Georgetown University.&#x201c;Brilliant.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Jeff Biggers</b><b>, </b><b><i>Huffington Post</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;A splendid study of the contested meaning of "American" from the 1880s through the New Deal, this is an episodic case study of Cochise County, Arizona, best known as the locus for the gunfight at the OK Corral.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>E.

Especially insightful, and particularly troubling, is her account of the hardening of racial categories along the U.S.-Mexican border. Anyone who cares about the historical origins of contemporary debates about race, immigration, and power will need to reckon with the stories of the "borderline Americans" whose lives Benton-Cohen reconstructs with such grace and compassion.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Thomas G.

America has been exceptional in its rising inequality after an egalitarian start, but not in its long-run growth.</p><p>America had already achieved world income leadership by 1700, not just in the twentieth century as is commonly thought. Long before independence, American colonists enjoyed higher living standards than Britain&#x2015;and America's income advantage today is no greater than it was three hundred years ago. But that advantage was lost during the Revolution, lost again during the Civil War, and lost a third time during the Great Depression, though it was regained after each crisis. In addition, Lindert and Williamson show how income inequality among Americans rose steeply in two great waves&#x2015;from 1774 to 1860 and from the 1970s to today&#x2015;rising more than in any other wealthy nation in the world. <i>Unequal Gains</i> also demonstrates how the widening income gaps have always touched every social group, from the richest to the poorest. The book sheds critical light on the forces that shaped American income history, and situates that history in a broad global context.</p><p>Economic writing at its most stimulating, <i>Unequal Gains</i> provides a vitally needed perspective on who has benefited most from American growth, and why.</p></p><p><p>"<i>Unequal Gains</i> provides a brilliant historical perspective on the market forces and political currents behind the explosion of economic disparities in the United States over the past four decades.

Lindert and Williamson provide new information about the qualitative and quantitative changes since the colonial period, mainly in the United States, but also in comparison with Great Britain and other nations. This is a major scholarly achievement."<b>--Stanley L. Engerman, University of Rochester</b></p><p>"<i>Unequal Gains</i> is a provocative book that forces us to change the ways we think, write, and teach about American and global economic history. Lindert and Williamson find that Americans have almost always had the world's highest incomes, that the United States may have been the first nation to achieve modern economic growth, and that economic inequality is less a price we pay for progress than a matter of policy choices."<b>--Richard Sylla, New York University</b></p><p>"In this magisterial book, Lindert and Williamson review and reestimate American economic growth and income distribution from before independence to today. The reader follows the growth of the American economy from its modest beginnings to its almost unchallenged global supremacy--but also its many distributional struggles.

Gardner, a trail-blazing American who was among the most prominent patrons of her day, built a Venetian-inspired palazzo in Boston to share her exquisite and thought-provoking art objects from diverse cultures and eras. She hosted luminaries in the worlds of music, dance, and literature, and supported such famed artists as Henry James and John Singer Sargent. The authors look at masterpieces by Botticelli, Rembrandt, Titian, and others, as well as hidden treasures, including decorative arts, correspondence, and photographs. Rather than positioning the museum simply as a historical gem, they present it as a site for forging connections between past and present and reinforcing the founder&#x2019;s legacy of sustaining contemporary art, music, and education.

The Hospitalist Physician is a relatively new concept within modern healthcare. As this new field evolves, so too will the educational needs of internists who have chosen to practice this discipline. This work is aimed squarely at addressing this need. Internal medicine residency programs in this country strive to equip new grads with a comprehensive set of skills for dealing with both inpatient and outpatient care. However, there remain practice management and workflow nuances that separate the traditional internist from the acute inpatient care physician, or hospitalist. These are the key areas that this work hopes to shed light upon, in addition to highlighting some of the intriguing procedural and critical care elements that hospitalist need to be strong in. It is hoped that this text will enable a physician to respond to the patients needs in real time, providing a service which was not possible for busy primary care doctors to perform in the recent past. This book will be used as an in-the-field guide for new hospitalists, focusing on two groups of readers: the new graduate from residency and the office-based internist that wishes to retrain and certify as a hospitalist physician. It is a practical text, with an illustrated procedures section, intended for use as a reference for hospital-based procedures. The Hospitalist will serve as a pocket guide for those intending to obtain rapid information on practice management principles unique to a hospitalist physician.</p><p>Manish Mehta, MD Hospitalist/Intensivist, Providence Medical Center, Medford OR Arun Thomas Mathews, MD National Director, Research and Medical Education; Director, Hospitalist Medicine, Apogee Physicians Group Lea Regional Medical Center, Hobbs NM</p><h2>A Midsummer Night&#39;s Dream (Calla Editions)</h2><p>William Heath Robinson was part of a family of artists that included brothers Thomas and Charles.

Unlike most studies of this kind, it includes an introduction to and developmental summary of the diverse Eucharistic liturgies of the Christian East. It also explores the various Western rites (Ambrosian, Gallican, and Mozarabic) in addition to the Roman. With regard to theological themes, the authors give special attention to the topics of real presence (including the &#34;consecration&#34; of the bread and wine) and eucharistic sacrifice, the most central and most ecumenically challenging issues since the sixteenth-century Reformations. Making the book especially teacher- and student-friendly are the summary points at the end of each chapter. Each chapter also contains an abundance of liturgical texts for ease of reference.</p><p>Paul F.

R, a powerful open-source software package, was created in response to this issue. It has enjoyed explosive growth since its introduction, owing to its coherence, flexibility, and free availability. While it is a valuable tool for students who are first learning statistics, proper introductory materials are needed for its adoption.<br><br><strong>Using R for Introductory Statistics</strong> fills this gap in the literature, making the software accessible to the introductory student. The author presents a self-contained treatment of statistical topics and the intricacies of the R software. The pacing is such that students are able to master data manipulation and exploration before diving into more advanced statistical concepts. The book treats exploratory data analysis with more attention than is typical, includes a chapter on simulation, and provides a unified approach to linear models.<br><br>This text lays the foundation for further study and development in statistics using R. Appendices cover installation, graphical user interfaces, and teaching with R, as well as information on writing functions and producing graphics. This is an ideal text for integrating the study of statistics with a powerful computational tool.</p><p><p>The author has made a very serious effort to introduce entry-level students of statistics to the open-source software package R. One mistake most authors of similar texts make is to assume some basic level of familiarity, either with the subject to be taught, or the tool (the software package) to be used in teaching the subject.

In <i>The Craft of Scene Writing</i>, accomplished screenwriter and master writing teacher Jim Mercurio analyzes and systematizes the beats, conflicts, character moments, action, dialogue, and structure that create powerful scenes. Citing examples from scripts old and new, <i>The Craft of Scene Writing</i> breaks down how great scenes reveal character, advance the story, and emotionally connect with audiences, plus demonstrates how to use these techniques in your own scripts. This incredibly detailed exploration of screenwriting technique will help beginning writers to write great scripts and experienced writers to gain a more complete mastery of their craft.</p><p><b>Jim Mercurio</b> is a writer, author, screenwriter and filmmaker.

Jim understands that scripts are just an accumulation of these story beats and it is our job as writers to obsess over each and every word and action to ensure that each beat is clear, concise, dramatic and surprising. Easier said than done, but Jim gives us the tools to chop, mold and sharpen these beats to gleaming bits of perfection."

Timpanogos beckons the urban populace of Utah. And yet, no &#x201c;Indian&#x201d; legend graced the mount until Mormon settlers conjured it&#x2015;once they had displaced the local Indians, the Utes, from their actual landmark, Utah Lake. <i>On Zion&#x2019;s Mount</i> tells the story of this curious shift. It is a quintessentially American story about the fraught process of making oneself &#x201c;native&#x201d; in a strange land. But it is also a complex tale of how cultures confer meaning on the environment&#x2015;how they create homelands.</p><p>Only in Utah did Euro-American settlers conceive of having a homeland in the Native American sense&#x2015;an endemic spiritual geography. They called it &#x201c;Zion.&#x201d; Mormonism, a religion indigenous to the United States, originally embraced Indians as &#x201c;Lamanites,&#x201d; or spiritual kin. <i>On Zion&#x2019;s Mount</i> shows how, paradoxically, the Mormons created their homeland at the expense of the local Indians&#x2015;and how they expressed their sense of belonging by investing Timpanogos with &#x201c;Indian&#x201d; meaning. </p><p>This same pattern was repeated across the United States. Jared Farmer reveals how settlers and their descendants (the new natives) bestowed &#x201c;Indian&#x201d; place names and recited pseudo-Indian legends about those places&#x2015;cultural acts that still affect the way we think about American Indians and American landscapes.</p></p><p>Jared Farmer is Associate Professor of history at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, and author of <i>Glen Canyon Dammed: Inventing Lake Powell and the Canyon Country</i>.&#x201c;This stunningly original book proves that geography and our sense of place are mere creations of history, and with it Jared Farmer has proven himself a brilliant trailblazer of the past in the Wallace Stegner tradition.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Francis Parkman Prize Committee, Society of American Historians</b><br><br>&#x201c;Magnificent historical storytelling, both fun and provocative.

He traces the physical and folkloric fallout of that complex history through to twentieth-century raconteurs, promoters, and developers who continued to reinvent the cultural landscape.

One of the most important problems in the design of networks (referred to as packet broadcast networks) that can take practical advantage of broadcast channels is how to achieve efficient sharing of a single common channel. Many multiple access protocols, or algorithms, for packet broadcast networks have been proposed, and much work has been done on the performance evaluation of the protocols. A variety of techniques have been used to analyze the performance; however, this is the first book to provide a unified approach to the performance evaluation problem by means of an approximate analytical technique called equilibrium point analysis. Two types of packet broadcast networks - satellite networks and local area networks are considered, and eight multiple access protocols are studied and their performance analyzed in terms of throughput and average message delay.</p><p><b>Contents<br></b>Part I: Fundamentals � Multiple Access Protocols and Performance � Equilibrium Point Analysis � Part II: Satellite Networks � S-ALOHA � R-ALOHA � ALOHA-Reservation � TDMAReservation � SRUC � TDMA � Performance Comparisons of the Protocols for Satellite Networks � Part III: Local Area Networks � Buffered CSMACD � BRAM</p><p><i>Performance Analysis of Multiple Access Protocols</i> is included in the Computer Systems Series, Research Reports and Notes, edited by Herb Schwetman.</p></p><p>Shuji Tasaka is Associate Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Nagoya Institute of Technology, Japan.</p><h2>Unorthodox Chess Openings</h2><p>This inclusive guide to every unorthodox opening used by chess players contains more than 500 weird, contentious, controversial, unconventional, arrogant, and outright strange openings.

The History Hidden by Paradise: A Case Study Notes Index About the Author</p><h2>This Life of Sounds</h2><p><em>This Life of Sounds</em> portrays an important and previously unexplored corner of the history of new music in America: the Center of the Creative and Performing Arts int eh State University of New York at Buffalo. Composers Lukas Foss (the Center's founder), Lejaren Hiller, and Morton Feldman were the music directors over the life of "the Buffalo group," during the years 1964-1980. Based on Foss's plan, the Rockefeller Foundation provided annual fellowships for young composers and virtuoso instrumentalists to live in Buffalo for up to two years, thus creating a cadre of like-minded musicians who would spend their time studying, creating, and performing difficult - often controversial - new work. The new legendary group of musicians (some would say "musical outlows") who participated in the Buffalo group included Pulitzer Prize winner George Crumb, Terry Riley, Cornelius Cardew, Maryanne Amacher, Frederic Rzewski, David Tudor, Julius Eastman, and many more. Composers John Cage, Jim Tenney, Iannis Xenakis and others all figure int he story as well. The book provides valuable accounts of the Center's influential concer series, Evenings for New Music, performed in Buffalo, New York and throughout Europe; its famous recording of Terry Riley's In C; the political activism of the time; and the intersection of academic, private, and institutional funding for the arts. Life magazine declared in an article about the 1965 Fest of the Arts Today titled, "Can This Be Buffalo?", "Buffalo exploded last month in a two-week avant garde festival that was bigger and hipper than anything ever held in Paris or New York..." The concerts, the festivals, and the adventurous musical climate attracted filmmakers and young visual arts resulting in what one person called "one of those kinds of places the way people talk about Vienna in 1900-1910."<br></p><p><br>Born in France, raised in New York and Mexico City, Levine Packer was co-director with Lukas Foss and Morton Feldman of the renowned contemporary music group in Buffalo, New York, and a director of the Contemporary Music Festival at teh California Institute of the Arts.

You want me to get right to it. Tell you how to write a winning resume, give you an outline or template, tell you how to fill it in, tell you where to post it. And that&#x2019;s that.<br><br>Well, much as I would love to do that, I just can&#x2019;t.<br>Resumes need a lot more thought these days. Since the Great Recession of 2008, resumes aren&#x2019;t working too well.<br><br>I&#x2019;m guessing you knew that.<br><br>Everyone assumes this is because there are no jobs these days.<br>Well, there are jobs. I&#x2019;m looking at the government&#x2019;s little-known report, sitting here on my desk right now. It&#x2019;s called JOLTS for short, but its full name is&nbsp;<i>Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey</i>. You can look it up on the Internet. It&#x2019;s issued monthly. This one is for January 2014. It reports that during that month, 4,500,000 people in the United States found jobs, and there were still 4,000,000 vacancies unfilled at the end of that month.&nbsp;That&#x2019;s a total of 8,500,000 vacancies filled or waiting to be filled. That month! That&#x2019;s pretty typical in the United States. Every month.<br><br>Now admittedly, that&#x2019;s not enough jobs or enough vacancies to fix our distressing unemployment problem. Still,&nbsp;<i>somebody&#x2019;s&nbsp;</i>getting those eight million jobs. Each month.<br>Why shouldn&#x2019;t you be among them?<br><br>Well, one reason&#x2014;a&nbsp;<i>big</i>&nbsp;reason&#x2014;may be your resume.<br>It almost certainly needs fixin&#x2019;.<br>Yesterday&#x2019;s resumes just aren&#x2019;t up to the task today.<br>Yesterday&#x2019;s resumes are like a dull knife trying to cut food. Need sharpening. Badly.<br>These days, you can&#x2019;t just fill out a resume, post it, and expect it to go anywhere.<br>Resumes now take more time than they used to.<br>They take more thought than they used to.<br>In this economic climate, you have to work harder to make yours effective, in finding those jobs that are out there.<br><br>But you can do it. Yes, you can.<br><br>That&#x2019;s what this little book is about.<br><br>Let&#x2019;s start simple, with some thinking. Or, rethinking.<br><br>Let&#x2019;s Start Simple<br><br>Okay, here&#x2019;s the story:<br>You want to find work. To find it, you&#x2019;ve got to secure an interview with some employer or employers who actually have the power to hire you. And employers are busy people.<br>They&#x2019;re not necessarily anxious to spend all day doing interviews. So, since you know that, you send someone on ahead of you, to plead your case for you.<br><br>And that&nbsp;<i>someone</i>&nbsp;is not actually a person but a piece of paper.<br><br>Yes, you send a piece of paper on ahead of you, to make the case as to why you should be invited in for an interview. And that piece of paper has a name. It is called a<i>&nbsp;resume.&nbsp;</i>Or resum�. Or r�sum�. Or its near cousin, CV (<i>curriculum vitae,&nbsp;</i>meaning &#x201c;the course of my life&#x201d;).<br><br>Now, the most interesting thing about this piece of paper (digital or real) is that while it looks like just a bunch of words, it really is a painting. And that&#x2019;s because employers have the same thing you do:&nbsp;<i>imagination.<br></i><br>Yes, your resume looks like just words. A lot of words. But when they&#x2019;re reading your resume, the words are lifting off the page and painting a picture of you in the imagination of the employer who reads it.<br><br>Employers wouldn&#x2019;t call it a painting; they would call it an &#x201c;impression&#x201d; of you. Same thing. They are looking at this piece of paper, covered with words, but they are thinking in terms of pictures. They are visualizing you.<br><br>Now, here&#x2019;s the question. Do the words they read make them visualize you as a competent worker, or not? Do the words they read make them visualize you as energetic, or not? As joyful, or not? As a team player, or not? As honest, or not?<br><br>And let&#x2019;s throw in: Do they visualize you as&nbsp;<i>tall, short,&nbsp;</i>or&nbsp;<i>average height? Young, middle-aged,&nbsp;</i>or&nbsp;<i>old?</i>&nbsp;Yes, those things aren&#x2019;t covered in your resume, but employers can&#x2019;t turn their imaginations off, just because they&#x2019;ve finished looking at this piece of paper you sent on ahead of you. Rightly or wrongly, they see, they imagine, beyond your words. That&#x2019;s just human nature.<br><br>But to my main point: It&#x2019;s not just words that determine whether or not they decide to call you in for an interview. It&#x2019;s the picture of you that these words paint in an employer&#x2019;s imagination that determines whether they invite you in, or not.<br><br>So, when you set out to compose your resume, you would do well to think of yourself overall as a painter, not a writer. Your paintbrushes are your words. What is the&nbsp;<i>picture</i>&nbsp;of you that they paint? That is the question you should ask yourself, when you&#x2014;or someone you hire&#x2014;are debating what words to set down in your resume.<br><br><b>Eight Seconds</b><br>Let&#x2019;s say you see a job posting. Some employer is looking for someone to fill a vacancy or a job newly created. You send in your resume. And you want to know how long an employer will likely spend looking at this resume/painting of you that you are sending on ahead, to plead your case for you. The answer will vary, of course.<br><br>There&#x2019;s a difference, for example, between how long the owner of a restaurant will spend looking at the resume you drop off, when you are applying to become the manager there, versus how long a multibillion-dollar corporation will spend looking at your resume when 250 came in that day. With a small employer you might get as much as two minutes. With larger employers, we know<i>&nbsp;</i>(<i>because people have measured it</i>) that generally your resume will get between four and fifteen seconds of attention. The average is eight.<br><br>Eight seconds! Yikes! An employer is going to be reading down your resume fast. In fact, they may not get all the way to the bottom in those eight seconds. So, what they read first, what they see in the top half or even top third of your resume, is going to be determinative.<br><br>What can you do about&nbsp;<i>that</i>?<br>What can you do about this painting that the employers may be taking only a fast look at?<br><br>Well, real painters of course paint in various ways. But, as we can tell from the sketchbooks of famous painters like Rembrandt (right<b>*</b>), they usually begin by laying down in broad strokes the outline of the whole portrait or picture. Then later they fill in. Details, shading, and such.<br><br>If your resume is only going to get eight seconds of attention, then it must do something like that. In the top third of your resume you must lay down in broad strokes an outline of who you are, using the words you write. Enough to make the employer hungry to see what else you have to say for yourself, as during the remaining two-thirds you shade and fill in. So to speak.</p><h2>Groups That Work: Structure and Process</h2><p>Social workers, planners, health professionals, and human-service administrators spend much of their time in meetings, working in and with groups. What meaning does participation in these groups have for members? Some of the events that are most important for members of the various professions, and those whom they serve, take place within these groups. Health and human services depend upon their working groups for their development and allocation of resources, their standards of quality, and the evaluation of their success or failure. In short, these groups are relied upon to come up with creative solutions to complex problems. <br><br>Despite the amount of time spent in meetings, committees, and so on, very little has been written about the skills necessary for effective participation and leadership within working groups. With that in mind, Ephross and Vassil combine innovative group theory and practice in this "how-to" guide for professionals who take a variety of roles within the group. They draw on examples from social agencies, a hospital, a low-income community, and the boardroom, providing practical principles for day-to-day group life based on a democratic model. This revised edition also explores the changes that have taken place in the structure and operation of working groups in recent years and the heightened expectations for groups within large organizations.</p><p>Health and human services depend upon working groups for their development and allocation of resources, their standards of quality, and the evaluation of their success or failure.

His first children&#x2019;s book, a story of a small family of pigs titled The Mellops Go Flying, is published by Harper &amp; Row and awarded the prestigious Spring Book Festival prize. In a short number of years he did his first advertising campaign for Burroughs machines, drew for the New York Times, Esquire, Life, Holiday, Harpers, and television, completed the Mellops series and published other prize-winning books for children, including Crictor, Adelaide, Emil, The Three Robbers, and Rufus. In the same period, he also published satirical books like Horrible and The Underground Sketchbook, and his first erotic collections, The Party and Fornicon. In 1970 he moved his family to Nova Scotia, before settling in 1976 in Ireland where he still lives. In the 1980s Ungerer was given a 25 year career retrospective show in Paris at the Mus�e des Arts D�coratifs, was made a Commander of the French Order of Arts and Letters, and was invited by Jack Lang, France&#x2019;s Cultural Minister, to establish a Franco-German cultural exchange. In 1991 Tomi Ungerer donated 4,500 drawings and 2,500 toys from his personal collection to the city of Strasbourg, which will honor this native son in a 70th birthday celebration later this year. In 1993, Ungerer published Die Gedanken sind frei (Thoughts are Free), a book about his World War II childhood, also published in English as Tomi, a Childhood under the Nazis. Over the years, he has vigorously continued to create art and to publish books including Poster, a collection of all his advertising work, Flix (his first children&#x2019;s book since 1974) Mon Alsace, and Cats As Cats Can. In 1998 Tomi Ungerer was awarded the Hans Christian Andersen Prize, the Nobel Prize of children&#x2019;s publishing and, in 2001, was made an Officer of the L�gion d&#x2019;Honneur. Tomi Ungerer is presently serving as ambassador to the European Council.Erotoscope is a glimpse into a mind that's been turning unexpected illustrative tricks for decades. -- <i>Nerve.com, February 2002</i><br><br>TASCHEN's wonderfully fat new retrospective volume of Tomi Ungerer's sexy hallucinations brims with 400 drawings, half of them previously unpublished. -- <i>Libido.com, March 2002</i></p><h2>Intellectual Mastery of Nature.

In the nineteenth century, however, readers considered both <i>Tom Sawyer</i> and <i>Huckleberry Finn</i> as works of literature equally for children and adults; only later was the former relegated to the category of "boys' books" while the latter, even as it was canonized, came frequently to be regarded as unsuitable for young readers. Adults&#x2015;women <i>and</i> men&#x2015;wept over <i>Little Women</i>. And America's most prestigious literary journals regularly reviewed books written for both children and their parents. This egalitarian approach to children's literature changed with the emergence of literary studies as a scholarly discipline at the turn of the twentieth century. Academics considered children's books an inferior literature and beneath serious consideration.</p><p>In <i>Kiddie Lit</i>, Beverly Lyon Clark explores the marginalization of children's literature in America&#x2015;and its recent possible reintegration&#x2015;both within the academy and by the mainstream critical establishment. Tracing the reception of works by Mark Twain, Louisa May Alcott, Lewis Carroll, Frances Hodgson Burnett, L. Frank Baum, Walt Disney, and J. K. Rowling, Clark reveals fundamental shifts in the assessment of the literary worth of books beloved by both children and adults, whether written for boys or girls. While uncovering the institutional underpinnings of this transition, Clark also attributes it to changing American attitudes toward childhood itself, a cultural resistance to the intrinsic value of childhood expressed through sentimentality, condescension, and moralizing.</p><p>Clark's engaging and enlightening study of the critical disregard for children's books since the end of the nineteenth century&#x2015;which draws on recent scholarship in gender, cultural, and literary studies&#x2015; offers provocative new insights into the history of both children's literature and American literature in general, and forcefully argues that the books our children read and love demand greater respect.</p></p><p><p><b>Beverly Lyon Clark </b> is the A.

Highly recommended."</p> (<i>Choice</i>)<br><br><p>"Terrific and important...

A 'must read' for scholars in children's literature."</p> (<i>Children's Literature Association Quarterly</i>)<br><br><p>"[Clark's] thorough documentation of the vagaries of the reception of 'kiddie lit' proves that our negative valuations of youth culture deserve rethinking."</p> (Ilana Nash <i>Women's Review of Books</i>)<br><br><p>"Beverly Lyon Clark has succeeded admirably in portraying children's literature as a contested cultural field and revealing changes in the meanings and relevance in children's books over the course of 150 years.

The first part offers readings from the German Bible, enabling students to gain confidence by beginning with familiar texts. The second part presents more difficult readings drawn from the writings of several German theologians, including Martin Luther, Albert Schweitzer, Karl Barth, Helmut Thielicke, Adolf Schlatter, and Rainer Riesner. The dictionary, previously published as a separate volume, contains over 20,000 terms. Many of these terms are part of the specialized theological vocabulary not generally found, or given but slight treatment, in standard German dictionaries.Helmut W. Ziefle (Ph.D., University of Illinois) is professor of German at Wheaton College, where he has taught since 1967. He has written several books, most of which are in German, his native language.</p><h2>Magical Places: An Enchanted Journey through Mystical Sites, Haunted Houses, and Fairytale Forests</h2><p><b>An enchanting, illustrated guide to the world's most magical places, from fairy tale forests to haunted houses, from the author of <i>Practical Magic</i>.</b><br><i></i><i><br></i><i>Magical Places</i> is for armchair-voyagers and pilgrimage-makers alike.

Or is it better understood in more collective terms, as an institution that communities reshape over time to promote evolving goals? What should it mean to be a private landowner in an age of sprawling growth and declining biological diversity? These provocative questions lie at the heart of this perceptive and wide-ranging new book by legal scholar and conservationist Eric Freyfogle. Bringing together insights from history, law, philosophy, and ecology, Freyfogle undertakes a fascinating inquiry into the ownership of nature, leading us behind publicized and contentious disputes over open-space regulation, wetlands protection, and wildlife habitat to reveal the foundations of and changing ideas about private ownership in America.Drawing upon ideas from Thomas Jefferson, Henry George, and Aldo Leopold and interweaving engaging accounts of actual disputes over land-use issues, Freyfogle develops a powerful vision of what private ownership in America could mean&#x2014;an ownership system, fair to owners and taxpayers alike, that fosters healthy land and healthy economies.</p><p>Eric T. Freyfogle is the author of <i>Bounded People, Boundless Lands</i> (Island Press, 1998), winner of the 1999 Adult Nonfiction Award of the Society of Midland Authors, and co-editor of <i>For the Health of the Land</i> (Island Press, 1999). He teaches natural-resources, property, and land-use law at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign."Freyfogle's argument that private property is an organic, natural entity that has evolved from age to age&#x2014;not a static concept bound by immutable laws&#x2014;comes just in time for a renewed debate on the subject. Goodness knows we need some fresh thinking on the matter, and Freyfogle has supplied it." (John Hanson Mitchell, author of "Trespassing: An Inquiry into the Private Ownership")<br><br>"<i>The Land We Share</i> is an extraordinarily lucid and creative analysis that clears the fog that has descended on issues of property ownership and rights. This is essential reading." (David W. Orr, author of "The Nature of Design")<br><br>"What does it mean to own land? No one has thought more deeply or written more lucidly about this question than Eric Freyfogle. He brings to the discussion a sure knowledge of American history and law, a keen awareness of our ecological predicament, and a lively tongue."

Henry David Thoreau subverted both clock and calendar, using them not to regulate time&#x2019;s passing but to open up and explore its presence. This little volume thus embodies, in small compass, Thoreau&#x2019;s own ambition to &#x201c;live in season&#x201d;&#x2014;to turn with the living sundial of the world, and, by attuning ourselves to nature, to heal our modern sense of discontinuity with our surroundings.<br> &nbsp;<br> Ralph Waldo Emerson noted with awe that from flowers alone, Thoreau could tell the calendar date within two days; children remembered long into adulthood how Thoreau showed them white waterlilies awakening not by the face of a clock but at the first touch of the sun. As Thoreau wrote in <i>Walden</i>, &#x201c;Time is but the stream I go a-fishing in. I drink at it; but while I drink I see the sandy bottom and detect how shallow it is.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Drawn from the full range of Thoreau&#x2019;s journals and published writings, and arranged according to season, <i>The Daily Henry David Thoreau</i> allows us to discover the endless variation and surprise to be found in the repetitions of mundane cycles. Thoreau saw in the kernel of each day an earth enchanted, one he honed into sentences tuned with an artist&#x2019;s eye and a musician&#x2019;s ear. Thoreau&#x2019;s world lives on in his writing so that we too may discover, even in a fallen world, a beauty worth defending.</p><p><b>Henry David Thoreau </b>(1817&#x2013;1862) was an essayist, poet, and philosopher best known for his book <i>Walden</i>.&nbsp;<b>Laura Dassow Walls</b> is the William P. and Hazel B.

Neustadt to investigate a troubling episode in U.S.-British relations. His confidential report&#x2015;intended for a single reader, JFK himself, and classified for thirty years&#x2015;is reproduced in its entirety here. <br> <br>The Anglo-American crisis arose out of a massive misunderstanding between the two governments. The British Prime Minister, Harold Macmillan, had been operating on the assumption that Washington would proceed with, and sell for British use, an airborne missile system named Skybolt. In its defense planning, the United Kingdom relied on Skybolt to sustain its nuclear deterrent. The Americans, however, decided to cancel the program. This decision rocked the British government and seriously strained Anglo-American relations.</p><p>Upon reading Neustadt's report, Kennedy passed it to his wife, Jacqueline, remarking, "If you want to know what my life is like, read this." She had it with her in Texas five days later, when he was killed. Today the document remains fascinating for the insight it provides into American-style foreign policymaking. This volume adds to the report Kennedy's comments, a glossary, a cast of characters, and new information gleaned from recently declassified British files.</p></p><p><p>Richard E.

Enjoy!" - <i><b>Susun S. Weed, author, The Wise Woman Way series, including New Menopausal Years</b></i></p><br><br><p>"According to Brigitte (The Country Almanac of Home Remedies; Naropa Univ.) and Fiedler (Beat Sugar Addiction Now!; contributing author, Prevention Magazine), natural cures can help battle stress, anxiety, depression, and chronic pain and improve sleep and mental acuity. Offering medical disclaimers and common-sense cautions such as not mixing prescription drugs with alcohol and advising medical professionals of any natural remedies one is applying, the authors maintain that these kinds of therapies can improve a person's well-being and balance by restoring a sense of joy and contentment. A brief discussion of holistic practices and natural remedies (acupuncture, acupressure, aromatherapy, craniosacral therapy, flower essences, herbs, homeopathy, massage therapy, meditation, qigong, reflexology, and yoga) leads to material on stress, anxiety, mood, rest, brain power, weight, energy, pain, grief, trauma, joy, and happiness. The appendix includes brief, informational blurbs on essential herbs (name, plant family, medicinal uses, and contraindications); aromatherapy (plant purpose, formula, and usage); teas, resources, and a bibliography. There is also a comprehensive index. The writing style, a mix of both friendly and technical with some industry terms, is intelligible. While serviceable to the average reader, the book would be stronger had the authors replaced jargon (e.g., "tonify" and "chologogue") with commonly spoken English or included a glossary. �VERDICT Despite the occasional jargon, this title is affordable, informative, and basic.

Why not both? After Basil Hallward paints a beautiful, young man's portrait, his subject's frivolous wish that the picture change and he remain the same comes true. Dorian Gray's picture grows aged and corrupt while he continues to appear fresh and innocent. After he kills a young woman, "as surely as if I had cut her little throat with a knife," Dorian Gray is surprised to find no difference in his vision or surroundings. "The roses are not less lovely for all that. The birds sing just as happily in my garden." <p> As Hallward tries to make sense of his creation, his epigram-happy friend Lord Henry Wotton encourages Dorian in his sensual quest with any number of Wildean paradoxes, including the delightful "When we are happy we are always good, but when we are good we are not always happy." But despite its many languorous pleasures, <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i> is an imperfect work. Compared to the two (voyeuristic) older men, Dorian is a bore, and his search for ever new sensations far less fun than the novel's drawing-room discussions. Even more oddly, the moral message of the novel contradicts many of Wilde's supposed aims, not least "no artist has ethical sympathies. An ethical sympathy in an artist is an unpardonable mannerism of style." Nonetheless, the glamour boy gets his just deserts. And Wilde, defending Dorian Gray, had it both ways: "All excess, as well as all renunciation, brings its own punishment."</p>Oscar Wilde's only published full length novel, is the story of a man who sells his soul for eternal youth. In exchange, what does he give up and what does he gain? This novel, by Wilde is a wonderful soul-searching example of the cost of paradise, and the price of a wish. <p>Read by actor, comedian, novelist, journalist, screenwriter Stephen Fry, Dorian Gray's dilemma comes alive. He has also acted in a variety of films including A Fish Called Wanda, Peter's Friends, and The Wind in the Willows.</p></p><h2>Creative Word: Canon As a Model for Biblical Education</h2><p>The author analyzes the theology and function of the three divisions of the Hebrew Bible: Torah, Prophets, and Writings.</p><p></p><h2>Storey Guide to Ancient Greek Drama</h2><p>This <i>Blackwell Guide</i> introduces ancient Greek drama, which flourished principally in Athens from the sixth century BC to the third century BC.<br> <ul> <li>A broad-ranging and systematically organised introduction to ancient Greek drama.<br> </li> <li>Discusses all three genres of Greek drama &#x2013; tragedy, comedy, and satyr play.<br> </li> <li>Provides overviews of the five surviving playwrights &#x2013; Aeschylus, Sophokles, Euripides, Aristophanes, and Menander, and brief entries on lost playwrights.<br> </li> <li>Covers contextual issues such as: the origins of dramatic art forms; the conventions of the festivals and the theatre; the relationship between drama and the worship of Dionysos; the political dimension; and how to read and watch Greek drama.<br> </li> <li>Includes 46 one-page synopses of each of the surviving plays.</li> </ul></p><p>This Guide provides a broad-ranging introduction to ancient Greek drama, which flourished principally in Athens from the sixth century BC to the third century BC.

In Professor Rahman's view the intellectual and therefore the social development of Islam has been impeded and distorted by two interrelated errors. The first was committed by those who, in reading the Koran, failed to recognize the differences between general principles and specific responses to 'concrete and particular historical situations.' . . . This very rigidity gave rise to the second major error, that of the secularists. By teaching and interpreting the Koran in such a way as to admit of no change or development, the dogmatists had created a situation in which Muslim societies, faced with the imperative need to educate their people for life in the modern world, were forced to make a painful and self-defeating choice&#x2014;either to abandon Koranic Islam, or to turn their backs on the modern world."&#x2014;Bernard Lewis, <i>New York Review of Books</i><br> <br> "In this work, Professor Fazlur Rahman presents a positively ambitious blueprint for the transformation of the intellectual tradition of Islam: theology, ethics, philosophy and jurisprudence.

More importantly, how does one get to 'normative' Islam? The author counsels, and passionately demonstrates, that for Islam to be actually what Muslims claim it to be&#x2014;comprehensive in scope and efficacious for every age and place&#x2014;Muslim scholars and educationists must reevaluate their methodology and hermeneutics.

From the long struggles between the Lancastrians and the Yorkists, the so-called Wars of the Roses, the country had emerged in 1485 shaken but united at last under the strong rule of the Tudors. To Elizabethans, this period of civil war was still a recent event that had tested and almost destroyed England&#x2019;s nationhood. They were, moreover, still troubled by political and dynastic uncertainties of their own. Queen Elizabeth, granddaughter of the first Tudor king, Henry VII, was unmarried and aging, and her successor unchosen. Her Catholic enemies at home and abroad plotted a return to the ancient faith renounced by Henry VIII in his reformation of the church. Spain had attempted an invasion of England with the great Armada in 1588, perhaps two years before Shakespeare began writing his Henry VI plays. It was in such an era of crisis and patriotic excitement that the Henry VI plays first appeared. Indeed, they helped to establish the vogue of the English history play, which was to flourish throughout the 1590s. England&#x2019;s civil wars could be studied and analyzed now, from a perspective of over one hundred years later, and perhaps could provide a key to the present time. At hand was a new edition of Raphael Holinshed&#x2019;s Chronicles, 1587, along with the earlier chronicle writings of Robert Fabyan, John Stow, and Richard Grafton, as well as Edward Hall&#x2019;s Union of the Two Noble and Illustrate Families of Lancaster and York, John Foxe&#x2019;s Acts and Monuments of Martyrs, and A Mirror for Magistrates.<br><br>How had these wars begun? Elizabethans searched for an answer, not in economic or social terms, but in religious and moral ones. According to a traditional and government-sponsored explanation, reflected to a large extent (though with many contradictions) in the chronicles of Edward Hall, and familiar to Shakespeare whether he agreed with it or not, the Wars of the Roses were a manifestation of God&#x2019;s wrath, a divine punishment inflicted on the English people for their wayward behavior. The people and their rulers had brought civil war on themselves by self-serving ambition, arrogance, and disloyalty. King Henry VI&#x2019;s grandfather, Henry IV, had come to the throne in 1399 by deposing and then executing his own cousin, Richard II (a momentous event, to be portrayed by Shakespeare in a later history play). Henry VI was himself an infant when he succeeded to the throne in 1422, owing to the untimely death of his father, Henry V. Too young at first to rule and never blessed with his father&#x2019;s ability to act decisively, Henry VI was utterly unable to halt the struggle for power that developed among members of his large and discordant family. Ultimately, his very title to the throne was challenged by his kinsman Richard Plantagenet, Duke of York, who claimed to be rightful king by virtue of his descent from Henry IV&#x2019;s uncle Lionel, Duke of Clarence. The Yorkist faction marched to battle against Henry VI&#x2019;s Lancastrian faction (so named because for gen- erations the family had been possessors of the dukedom of Lancaster), and the war was on.<br><br>The providential view of these events was never wholly endorsed by the chroniclers and certainly not by Shakespeare. Edward Hall&#x2019;s overall scheme is undeniably providential, and yet, as a historian, he presents a multiplicity of detail that cumulatively raises difficult issues of interpretation. At the same time, the providential view made good propaganda for the Tudor regime, and as such it gave widespread currency to the theory of God&#x2019;s anger toward a rebellious people. The outcome of the war seemed to confirm this pattern: universal devastation and the deaths of those most responsible for the conflict led eventually, according to the theory, to appeasement of God&#x2019;s anger and a restoration of order. Richard Plantagenet died in the struggle, as did Henry VI, Henry&#x2019;s son Edward, and much of the English nobility. Richard&#x2019;s son Edward survived to become Edward IV, but his manner of obtaining the throne was so manifestly offensive to Providence that (according to the theory) he suffered a retributive death at the hands of an angry God and was succeeded by his younger brother, Richard III. This last Yorkist ruler governed only two years, 1483&#x2013;1485, and it was through Richard&#x2019;s insane vengeance that God finally settled all his scores against the wayward English people. Having completed this purgation, God chose as his instrument of a new order Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond, Henry VII. Although Henry&#x2019;s return to England and defeat of Richard at the battle of Bosworth Field might outwardly resemble Henry IV&#x2019;s seizure of power from Richard II, the difference was crucial to Tudor apologists. Richard III had to be seen, from the Tudor point of view, not as a flawed legitimate monarch, but as a mad usurper and tyrant; his defeat was not the disobedient act of one man but a rising up of the entire English nation at the prompting of divine command. Henry VII&#x2019;s accession to power was officially viewed not as a precedent for further rebellion but as a manifestation of divine will without parallel in human history.<br><br>The essence of this providential view of events was that divine retribution and eventual reconciliation revealed themselves in the history of the war. The theory, of course, served the interests of the Tudor state and was in part a propaganda weapon calculatedly employed by the ruling class. Shakespeare&#x2019;s commitment to it should not be taken for granted, and indeed a number of recent studies have expressed a profound skepticism toward the theory as the basis of Shakespeare&#x2019;s dramaturgy. Especially in his later tetralogy, or four-play series, from Richard II to Henry V, Shakespeare reveals considerably more interest in the clash of personalities than in patterns of divine retribu- tion. Shakespeare does not endorse the orthodox view that Bolingbroke&#x2019;s seizure of the throne is a violation of divine purpose for which he and England must be humbled; instead, Shakespeare portrays the issues as many-sided and subject to varying interpretations.<br><br>Throughout his history plays, indeed, Shakespeare avoids expressing the Tudor view of recent history through didactic narrators or chorus figures who might seem to represent the point of view of the entire plays; instead, he puts this interpretation into the mouths of avowedly biased and self-interested characters whose motives and testimony the audience can then evaluate as it sees fit. In 1 Henry VI, for example, the most detailed exposition of the official historical view is given to Mortimer (2.5), whose interpretation, though given special authority by the fact that a dying man is speaking, is self-interestedly consistent with his own frustrated claim to the English throne. His nephew, Richard Plantagenet, who of course endorses the anti-Lancastrian logic of Mortimer&#x2019;s speech, is portrayed as consumed with ambition for the crown. In Shakespeare&#x2019;s depiction of the Lancastrian-Yorkist conflict, neither side maintains a consistent ideological position but, instead, shifts argument as required by the expediency of the moment. Although in his earlier tetralogy from 1 Henry VI to Richard III Shakespeare does sometimes allow his contending characters to hearken back to the deposition of Richard II in order to explain the misfortunes of England&#x2019;s civil wars, those characters often speak from self- interest and interpret history to their own advantage.<br><br>The individual plays of this earlier tetralogy, if seen or read separately, do not consistently comfort the spectator or reader with an assurance that all is working out according to God&#x2019;s plan. The events themselves, seen from the immediate perspective of the moment, provide little comfort. At the end of 1 Henry VI, King Henry has surrendered to a disastrous marriage and has lost most of France; at the end of 2 Henry VI, the good Duke Humphrey of Gloucester is dead and his opportunistic political enemies are about to take King Henry off of his throne. The hostilities of Lancaster and York end at the conclusion of 3 Henry VI, to be sure, but prospects for a stable peace are doubtful in view of Richard of Gloucester&#x2019;s baleful presence. The reciprocity of slaughter visited on both sides appears to stem as much from humanity&#x2019;s insane desire for vengeance as from God&#x2019;s evening of the score. Only in Richard III do we retroactively see a pattern of divine anger, retribution, and eventual appeasement that can then be applied to the tetralogy as a continuous narrative. E. M. W. Tillyard&#x2019;s argument for a providential reading of these plays (in his Shakespeare&#x2019;s History Plays, 1944) is based not coincidentally on a view of the tetralogy as a cohesive whole. What about the playgoers who saw the plays one at a time? The plays, so far as we know, were written and produced singly and were never staged in a continuous series. Even though the tetralogy as a whole may harmonize in part with the chronicles of Edward Hall and others, written to glorify the Tudor state and to give thanks for its having ended the prolonged anarchy of the fifteenth century, we can see that Shakespeare is no apologist for the Tudor state. He gives expression to a widely felt anxiety about political chaos. In each individual play and throughout the tetralogy, the overriding cosmic irony stressing the gulf between foolish humanity and the inscrutable intentions of Providence offers a potentially stirring conflict of which Shakespeare makes rich use.<br><br>Shakespeare wrote his first tetralogy some time between 1589 and 1592. Thomas Nashe&#x2019;s Pierce Penniless, 1592, refers to 1 Henry VI as a huge crowd-pleaser; Robert Greene&#x2019;s A Groatsworth of Wit rephrases a line from 3 Henry VI in that same year; Philip Henslowe&#x2019;s diary records performances of &#x201c;harey VI&#x201d; in the spring of 1592; and in that same year, the Earl of Pembroke&#x2019;s Men, who staged a version of 3 Henry VI under the title The True Tragedy of Richard, Duke of York, went out of business. Just how much of this first tetralogy may have been planned out when Shakespeare began work is hard to say. In fact, the very order of composition has long been in dispute. Despite the commonsense pleading of Dr. Johnson that Part Two follows from Part One as a logical consequence, some scholars argue that Part One was composed last. One piece of evidence is that a corrupt version of Part Two was published in quarto version in 1594 as The First Part of the Contention Betwixt the Two Famous Houses of York and Lancaster and that a corrupt version of Part Three was published in octavo in 1595 as The True Tragedy of Richard Duke of York. Part One had to await publication in the First Folio of 1623 and was registered for publication at that time as &#x201c;The third part of Henry the sixth.&#x201d; It seems odd, moreover, that Parts Two and Three make no mention of Lord Talbot, so prominent in Part One. If, however, as seems likely, the early printed versions of Parts Two and Three were memorial reconstructions without the authority of the official playbook, the claim of Part Two to have been written first may be unsubstantial. The very fact of prior publication of Parts Two and Three could explain why Part One was called &#x201c;The third part&#x201d; in 1623. Although Talbot is not mentioned in Parts Two and Three, these texts do recall important aspects of Part One. It is certainly possible that Shakespeare wrote all three parts in normal order.<br><br>Equally vexing is the question of authorship. Many Elizabethan plays were written by teams of authors, and Shakespeare might have collaborated with others, especially at the beginning of his career. Perhaps he rewrote older works by such writ- ers as Thomas Nashe, Robert Greene, and Christopher Mar- lowe. Theories of multiple authorship, once a commonplace of nineteenth-century scholarship and then discounted by much twentieth-century criticism, have recently been argued anew by the editors of the Oxford Shakespeare (1986). Yet there is much reason to believe that Shakespeare is essentially the author of the entire Henry VI series. Greene&#x2019;s famous resentment toward Shakespeare as the &#x201c;upstart crow beautified with our feathers&#x201d; seems more the envy of a lesser talent than the righteous indignation of one who has been plagiarized. The chief criteria used to &#x201c;disintegrate&#x201d; the plays into the hands of various supposed contributors are those of taste and style; for example, the low comic scenes of Joan of Arc were long held to be too coarse for Shakespeare&#x2019;s genius. Today most critics see a consistency of view throughout the Henry VI plays, despite minor inconsistencies of fact that might be the result of simple error or of using multiple sources, and they find nothing in these plays inimical to Shakespeare&#x2019;s budding genius. This belief confirms the judgment of Heminges and Condell, Shakespeare&#x2019;s fellow actors and editors of the 1623 Folio, who placed all the Henry VI plays among Shakespeare&#x2019;s collected works in their historical order.<br><br>If Shakespeare was at least chiefly responsible for the Henry VI series, he may also have been an important innovator in the new genre of the history play. Only the anonymous Famous Victories of Henry V is certainly earlier in dealing with recent English history. There were, to be sure, plays about legendary British history, such as Gorboduc or The Misfortunes of Arthur, or about far-off lands, such as Cambises or Marlowe&#x2019;s Tamburlaine. All these plays had explored by analogy political questions fascinating to Elizabethan England, and Tamburlaine&#x2019;s immense success had certainly established a vogue for grand scenes of military conquest. Still, the English history play as a recognizable form came into being with Henry VI. The success was evidently tremendous and established Shakespeare as a major playwright.<br><br>1 Henry VI, like all the plays in Shakespeare&#x2019;s first tetralogy, comprises a large number of episodes, a sizable cast of characters, and a wide geographical range. The subject is England&#x2019;s loss of French territories because of political division at home. The structure of the play is one of sequential action displayed in great variety and in alternating scenes that are thematically juxtaposed and contrasted with one another. In the rapid shifting back and forth between the English and French court, for example, Shakespeare establishes a paradoxical theme: France triumphs in England&#x2019;s weakness, not in her own strength. The French court is merely one of debased sexual frivolity. The English are naturally superior but are torn apart by internal dissension, by a &#x201c;jarring discord of nobility,&#x201d; and by a &#x201c;shouldering of each other in the court&#x201d; (4.1.188&#x2013;9) among those attempting to take advantage of Henry VI&#x2019;s weak minority rule and his vulnerable genealogical claim. Two of young Henry&#x2019;s kinsmen jockeying for position are Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, and the Bishop of Winchester. Humphrey&#x2019;s intentions are virtuous, but he is unable to prevent the opportunistic scheming of his rival. Winchester, despite his ecclesiastical calling, is a man of evil ambition and corrupt life, wholly intent on destroying the right-minded Gloucester. Shakespeare employs derisive anticlerical humor against Winchester and enlists the Protestant sympathies of his Elizabethan audience against the meddling Catholic Church&#x2019;s attempts to exploit England&#x2019;s weak kingship for its own ulterior purposes.<br><br>Even so, the menace threatening England is not seen as a Catholic conspiracy throughout; Winchester is only one opportunist seeking to exploit the political vacillation and factionalism at court. Of greater danger in the long term is Richard Plantagenet, scion of the Yorkist claim. From the start, Shakespeare portrays him as cunning, able to ingratiate him- self and bide his time, and ultimately ruthless. In these qualities...</p><h2>Hybrid, Electric, and Fuel-Cell Vehicles (Go Green with Renewable Energy Resources)</h2><p>HYBRID, ELECTRIC AND FUEL-CELL VEHICLES, Second Edition, covers the cutting-edge technology and technology that are revolutionizing today&#39;s automotive industry.

Two years after Charlotte&#x2019;s death, her friend <b>Elizabeth Gaskell</b>, herself a well-known novelist, completed work on <i>The Life of Charlotte Bront�,</i> a biography that was met with immediate acclaim by readers curious to discover more about the enigmatic author of <i>Jane Eyre.</i><br><br>Both a work of art and a well-documented interpretation of its subject, Gaskell&#x2019;s biography is an extraordinarily vivid and sensitive account of Bront�&#x2019;s outer and inner lives: her shyness and strangeness; her intense appreciation of the Bible, poetry, music, and the theater; her love of her family; and her fears of loneliness. Meant to be a defense and vindication of a noble, true, and tender woman,&#x201d; the book paints Bront� as an unforgettable figure careening between depression and exaltation. It also portrays her suffering. In her personal life, Bront� knew deprivation and loss, while in her artistic life, despite her fame, she had been taunted as coarse and had none of the advantages that a man might take for granted.<br><br>A powerful tribute from one writer to another, <i>The Life of Charlotte Bront�</i> remains one of the most evocative and perceptive biographies ever written.<br></p><p><b>Anne Taranto</b> was educated at Columbia and Oxford Universities and at Yale University, where she earned a Ph.D. She has taught courses on the novel and on eighteenth- and nineteenth-century literature at Georgetown University and is currently at work on a study of Charlotte Bront?&#x2019;s relationship to the literary marketplace.</p></p><p><b>Anne Taranto</b> was educated at Columbia and Oxford Universities and at Yale University, where she earned a Ph.D. She has taught courses on the novel and on eighteenth- and nineteenth-century literature at Georgetown University and is currently at work on a study of Charlotte Bront?&#x2019;s relationship to the literary marketplace. <br><b>From Anne Taranto&#x2019;s Introduction to <i>The Life of Charlotte Bront�<br><br></i></b><p>Gaskell, a friend of Bront?&#x2019;s and a famous novelist in her own right, undertook the biography project only months after Bront?&#x2019;s death in 1855 at the urging of Bront?&#x2019;s father the Reverend Patrick Bront?. Because Bront? was a celebrity, her death generated a lot of attention, most of it unwelcome to those who knew her personally. Bront?&#x2019;s oldest and closest friend, Ellen Nussey, who was especially troubled by the tabloid stories that were appearing, induced Charlotte&#x2019;s father to commission a definitive account of his daughter&#x2019;s life to counter the sensationalistic reports then circulating in the press. Patrick faced opposition from Bront?&#x2019;s husband, Arthur Bell Nicholls, who did not like how the public snatched at every gossiping account&#x201d; of his wife&#x2019;s life, and who wanted to keep her memory private. Patrick, who saw the project as a means of controlling Bront?&#x2019;s literary legacy, prevailed. No quailing, Mrs. Gaskell!&#x201d; Patrick directed, no drawing back!&#x201d; (<i>The Letters of Mrs. Gaskell</i>, letter 257; see For Further Reading&#x201d;).</p><p>Gaskell was herself a member of the hungry public at one time. She wanted desperately to find out who had written the literary sensation <i>Jane Eyre</i> (1847). By the time <i>Shirley</i> (1849) was published, Gaskell believed she had penetrated at least half of the mystery: Currer Bell [Bront?&#x2019;s pen name] (aha! what will you give me for a secret?) She&#x2019;s a she that I will tell you&#x201d; (<i>The Letters of Mrs. Gaskell</i>, letter 57). When Gaskell finally did meet Bront? in August 1850 they shared a natural affinity, but in many ways Gaskell came to know Bront? more completely through her research for the <i>Life</i> than she did through their friendship, which was of relatively brief duration. Gaskell and Bront? had the opportunity to meet on only five occasions, but they furthered their acquaintance through a correspondence that evidences a genuine professional and personal connection, although at heart the two women subscribed to different models of female authorship. In addition, as I discuss below, their friendship may have suffered in intimacy from Bront?&#x2019;s strategically conforming to social standards when she thought it would please Gaskell.</p><p>The <i>Life </i>is recognized as an enduring work of the nineteenth century, and it is ranked among the greatest biographies of all time. That said, it is important to remember that Bront?&#x2019;s life was written by a woman who was unsure if she liked <i>Jane Eyre</i>. Gaskell&#x2019;s intent in writing Bront?&#x2019;s life was to make the reader honour her as a woman, separate from her character as authoress&#x201d; (<i>The Letters of Mrs. Gaskell</i>, letter 242). Most readers know that Bront? was a literary sensation in her day, but modern audiences have lost sight of how polarizing her work was. Although she self-effacingly liked to style herself a plain country parson&#x2019;s daughter,&#x201d; her novels were incendiary. The aesthetic merit of Bront?&#x2019;s fiction was universally acknowledged, but the political subtexts of her novels provoked consternation. Her heroines registered a generalized discontent and a self-interest that was perceived by some as threatening to the accepted social order, which held that women naturally constituted the silent, self-sacrificing moral nucleus of society, the angel in the house.&#x201d; This ideological construction was coming under scrutiny in the mid-nineteenth century, under the rubric of the woman question.&#x201d; Advocates of female emancipation&#x201d; held that certain civil rights, suffrage among them, should be extended to women on the grounds that they were capable of exercising the same rational faculty as men.</p><p>Bront? provoked those on both ends of the political spectrum. Traditionalists deemed her engagement with female desire coarse,&#x201d; or immodest, and proponents of women&#x2019;s rights, who believed political gains could be achieved only by demonstrating women&#x2019;s rational equality with men, found her passionate heroines unsettling for other reasons. Bront? did not weigh in on the woman question&#x201d; in a positive way, but rather protested against current conditions without outlining solutions. Critics have only recently begun to understand Bront?&#x2019;s feminist agenda as psychological in impulse an impulse to expose the intangible constraints women face as subjects of a patriarchal system. Bront? was very much aware of the institutional nature of women&#x2019;s oppression, and the impact it had not simply on material issues, like economic independence, but on more fundamental yet harder to characterize concerns, such as intellectual and imaginative freedom. Millions are in silent revolt against their lot. Nobody knows how many rebellions besides political rebellions ferment in the masses of life which people earth,&#x201d; Jane Eyre warns her reader (p. 96).</p><p>Gaskell was working from a position of ambivalence in her defense of Bront?. She confesses to the reader that she cannot deny the existence of coarseness here and there in her works,&#x201d; and only ask[s] those who read them to consider her life, which has been openly laid bare before them&#x201d; (<i>The Letters of Mrs. Gaskell</i> letters 25a, 517). Gaskell is often faulted for attempting to exonerate Bront? by favoring the portrait of the <i>friend</i>, the <i>daughter</i>, the <i>sister</i>&#x201d; over that of the professional author (<i>The Letters of Mrs. Gaskell</i>, letter 267). Her reasoning for not including a critical discussion of Bront?&#x2019;s novels in the <i>Life</i>, as Bront?&#x2019;s father had desired, was that public opinion had already pronounced her fiat, set her seal&#x201d; upon them (<i>The Letters of Mrs. Gaskell</i>, letter 294). Nevertheless, in writing the <i>Life</i> Gaskell confronts her own ambivalence about Bront?&#x2019;s work, and in the process refines her ideas on women&#x2019;s professional engagement generally. The work is animated by that tension, and consequently it has broader implications that transcend its purported defense of one woman.</p></p><h2>Manga Classics The Scarlet Letter</h2><p>When Hester Prynne bears an illegitimate child, she is introduced to the ugliness, complexity, and ultimately the strength of the human spirit.

To Webster the Union was the indivisible expression of one nation of people. To Hayne the Union was the voluntary compact among sovereign states. Each man spoke more or less for his section, and their classic expositions of their respective views framed the political conflicts that culminated at last in the secession of the Southern states and war between advocates of Union and champions of Confederacy. <b><i>The Webster-Hayne Debate</i></b> consists of speeches delivered in the United States Senate in January of 1830. By no means were Webster and Hayne the only Senators who engaged in debate &#x201c;on the nature of the Union.&#x201d; Well over a score of the Senate&#x2019;s members spoke in response in sixty-five speeches all told, and these Senators did not merely echo either of the principals. The key speakers and viewpoints are included in <b><i>The Webster-Hayne Debate</i></b>. The volume opens with Hayne&#x2019;s speech, which, as Herman Belz observes, turned debates on &#x201c;the public lands&#x201d; into &#x201c;a clash between state sovereignty and national sovereignty, expounded as rival and irreconcilable theories of constitutional construction and the nature of the federal Union.&#x201d; Webster responded, Hayne retorted, and Webster concluded with an appeal to &#x201c;Liberty and Union, now and forever, one and inseparable,&#x201d; in what later historians would deem to be &#x201c;the most powerful and effective speech ever given in an American legislature.&#x201d; Other speeches in the volume are by Senators Thomas Hart Benton, John Rowan, William Smith, John M. Clayton, and Edward Livingston. Together, these speeches represent every major perspective on &#x201c;the nature of the Union&#x201d; in the early nineteenth century.</p> <p><b>Herman Belz</b> is Professor of History at the University of Maryland, and the author most recently of <i>A Living Constitution or Fundamental Law?: American Constitutionalism in Historical Perspective and Abraham Lincoln, Constitutionalism,</i> and <i>Equal Rights During the Civil War Era.</i></p></p><p>Herman Belz is a professor of American constitutional history at the University of Maryland.

Drawing on these considerations as well as the fossil record, he speculates on the attributes of the protobee, the common ancestor of all bees. He also cites the major literature on bee biology and describes the need for further research on the systematics and natural history of bees, including their importance as pollinators of crops and natural vegetation. The greater part of the work consists of an unprecedented treatment of bee systematics, with keys (many of them regional) for identification to the subgenus level. For each genus or subgenus, Michener includes a brief natural history describing geographical range, number of species, and noteworthy information pertaining to nesting or floral biology. </p><p>The work is beautifully illustrated with 48 color photos of bees, and more than 500 black and white drawings and photographs that depict behavior, detailed morphology, and ecology."At least since the time of Aristotle people have been interested in bees because they are fascinating creatures.

Even as the Chinese internet grows and online businesses thrive, speech is controlled, dissent quashed, and any attempts to organize outside the official Communist Party are quickly stamped out. Some are able to bypass the wall using VPNs, but this creates further a further divide between an intellectual class and the population at large, as those without the resources or digital knowhow are left in the dark. And there are hints that President Xi Jinping will soon fill in these leaks in the wall.<br> As censorship, distortion, and fake news gain traction around the world, James Griffiths takes a look inside the Great Firewall and explores just how far it has spread. He looks at how internet giants like Google and Facebook are bowing to pressure and agreeing to compromise internet freedoms in pursuit of the burgeoning Chinese market. Griffiths also shows how the spread of Chinese influence around the globe is tied to an increasing worldwide crackdown in online freedom. One of China&#x2019;s most insidious exports are its censorship techniques, and its Firewall is an inspiration for aspiring autocrats the world over.<br> &nbsp;Griffiths pushes back on the longstanding excuse that the internet is too big to be contained and makes the case that censorship tools are becoming more sophisticated at the very same time that users are becoming more complacent.

In many ways, coping is like breathing, an automatic process requiring no apparent effort. However, when people face truly threatening events--what psychologists call stressors--they become acutely aware of the coping process and respond by consciously applying their day-to-day coping skills. Coping is a fundamental psychological process, and people's skills are commensurately sophisticated. This volume builds on people's strengths and emphasizes their role as positive copers. It features techniques for preventing psychological problems and breaks from the traditional research approach, which is modeled on medicine and focuses on pathology and treatment. Collecting both award-winning research and new findings, this book may well set the agenda for research on stress and coping for the next century. <br> <br>These provocative and readable essays explore a variety of topics, including reality negotiation, confessing through writing, emotional intelligence, optimism, hope, mastery-oriented thinking, and more.

Unlike other reviews of the stress and coping literature, this collection focuses on coping strategies and efforts that work, when they work, and why they work. This is a volume you'd want to give to your graduate students and to your child head off to the first year of college. The work is useful not only for its descriptions of the resources that effective copers have, but also for understanding the efforts that people can make when they are having more difficulty coping." --Shelley E. Taylor, Professor of Social Psychology, University of California, Los Angeles<p></p><br>"Snyder has assembled a stellar group of theorists and researchers with an exceptional range of expertise in the arguably most important process in psychology: coping. The chapters are very well-written and provide superb coverage of the range, breadth, and depth of the issues involved in understanding coping processes. The combination of a prominent editor, first-rate authors, and a readable and comprehensive examination of coping should make this volume required reading for all mental health professionals." --Rick E. Ingram, Ph.D. Department of Psychology Doctoral Training Facility San Diego State University<p></p><br>"This volume provides one of the most timely, engaging, and optimistic approaches to the psychology of coping that is available in the literature today. The editor and chapter authors are leaders in developing a new focus in coping theory and research that embraces what Martin E.P.

It is also an outstanding introduction to philosophy of mind from the perspective of mental disorder.</p> <p>Revised and updated throughout, this <i>second edition</i> includes new discussions of grief and psychopathy, the problems of the psychophysical basis of disorder, the nature of selfhood, and clarification of the relation between rationality and mental disorder. Each chapter explores a central question or problem about mental disorder, including:</p> <ul> <ul> <p></p></ul> <li>what is mental disorder and can it be distinguished from neurological disorder? </li> <li>what roles should reference to psychological, cultural, and social factors play in the medical/scientific understanding of mental disorder? </li> <li>what makes mental disorders undesirable? Are they diseases? </li> <li>mental disorder and the mind&#x2013;body problem </li> <li>is mental disorder a breakdown of rationality? What is a rational mind? </li> <li>addiction, responsibility and compulsion </li> <li>ethical dilemmas posed by mental disorder, including questions of dignity and self-respect. </li></ul> <p>Each topic is clearly explained and placed in a clinical and philosophical context.

Its scope is broad and its presentation is clear and precise. It is a very impressive statement of a widespread and important philosophical perspective on mental illness, which everyone studying the philosophy of psychiatry will want to read ... It is clear enough, and vividly enough written, to be assigned fruitfully to undergraduates, but it also makes enough contributions to the central debates in the field to be important for specialists."<em> - Dominic Murphy and Gemma Smart,&nbsp;Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews</em></p> <p>"George Graham is contemporary philosophy&#x2019;s most gifted and humane writer. <em>The Disordered Mind</em> is a wise, deep, and thorough inquiry into the nature of the human mind and the various "creaks, cracks, and crevices" into which it is prone sometimes to wander... <em>The Disordered Mind</em> is a pedagogical, philosophical, and psychiatric tour de force." - <em>Owen Flanagan, Duke University, USA </em></p> <p>"The book is a success, it is consistently insightful and humane, and conveys a clear understanding not only of relevant philosophical topics, but also of a much more difficult issue, the relevance of those topics to understanding mental illness." - <em>Philip Gerrans, University of Adelaide, Australia</em></p> <p>"What Professor Graham's book does in effect is to provide a systematic overview of all of the issues surrounding the concept and theory of mental illness and thereby the central notions embedded in our mental health practices. Moreover, he performs this task with the utmost insight, wealth of knowledge, careful and detailed argumentation, brilliance and clarity of articulation that is certain to make this book a classic that will open the door for a dynamic and fruitful exchange between the two great fields of mental health and the philosophy of mind.</p> <p><em>The Disordered Mind</em> is a must read for anyone who is a psychiatrist, psychologist, philosopher, neurologist, or mental health worker. Indeed, it is a must read for any thoughtful person who simply desires to understand more deeply and more realistically the workings of their own mind as well as the workings of the human mind in general." - <em>Richard Garrett, Bentley University, USA</em></p></p><h2>Understanding Polymer Processing 1E: Processes and Governing Equations</h2><p>This book provides the background needed to understand not only the wide field of polymer processing, but also the emerging technologies associated with the plastics industry in the 21st century.

It takes place at some unspecified future date when mankind has entered another dark age characterized by irrationality, collectivism, and socialistic thinking and economics. Technological advancement is now carefully planned (when it is allowed to occur at all) and the concept of individuality has been eliminated (the use of the word &#34;I&#34; or &#34;Ego&#34; is punishable by death).</p><p>He lived in the dark ages of the future. In a loveless world he dared to love the woman of his choice. In an age that had lost all trace of science and civilization he had the courage to seek and find knowledge. But these were not the crime for which he would be hunted. He was marked for death because he had committed the unpardonable sin: he had stood forth from the mindless human herd. He was a man alone.<p>Ayn Rand's classic tale of a future dark age of the great "We" -- in which individuals have no name, no independence, and no values -- anticipates her later masterpieces, The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged.</p>Ayn Rand&#39;s first novel, We the Living, was published in 1936. With the publication of The Fountainhead in 1943, she achieved spectacular and enduring success. Through her novels and nonfiction writings, which express her unique philosophy, Objectivism, Rand maintains a lasting influence on popular thought.</p><h2>UNIX Power Tools</h2><p><p>Ideal for UNIX users who hunger for technical--yet accessible--information,<i>UNIX Power Tools</i> consists of tips, tricks, concepts, and freeware (CD-ROM included). It also covers add-on utilities and how to take advantage of clever features in the most popular UNIX utilities.This is a browser's book...like a magazine that you don't read from start to finish, but leaf through repeatedly until you realize that you've read it all. The book is structured so that it bursts at the seams with cross references. Interesting "sidebars" explore syntax or point out other directions for exploration, including relevant technical details that might not be immediately apparent. You'll find articles abstracted from O'Reilly Nutshell Handbooks�, new information that highlights program "tricks" and "gotchas," tips posted to the Net over the years, and other accumulated wisdom.The 55 chapters in this book discuss topics like file management, text editors, shell programming--even office automation. Overall, there's plenty of material here to satisfy even the most voracious appetites. The bottom line? <i>UNIX Power Tools</i> is loaded with practical advice about almost every aspect of UNIX. It will help you think creatively about UNIX, and will help you get to the point where you can analyze your own problems. Your own solutions won't be far behind.The CD-ROM includes all of the scripts and aliases from the book, plus<i>perl</i>, GNU <i>emacs</i>, <i>pbmplus</i> (manipulation utilities), <i>ispell</i>,<i>screen</i>, the <i>sc</i> spreadsheet, and about 60 other freeware programs. In addition to the source code, all the software is precompiled for Sun3, Sun4, DECstation, IBM RS/6000, HP 9000 (700 series), SCO Xenix, and SCO UNIX. (SCO UNIX binaries will likely also run on other Intel UNIX platforms, including Univel's new UNIXware.)</p></p><p>UNIX documentation typically comes in one of two flavors: at one extreme, light and fluffy books that assume you are a terrified PC user who needs to learn enough UNIX to get by at work, or massive and obscure tomes written for gurus, and indistinguishable from the most incomprehensible man pages. <p> This UNIX book, in contrast, assumes that you are basically a competent and intelligent individual, and that you are sufficiently secure in your self-image at work that you simply want to get things done, simply, by taking advantage of the real power of UNIX without having to learn "man-speak". It doesn't skimp on clear introductions and overviews, but the focus of the book is on practical examples of the most useful UNIX commands and utilities. A minor quibble: the enclosed CD-ROM is a bit heavy with utilities and packages that are probably already resident on your UNIX system (like Perl, Emacs, pbmplus), but it does contain scripts that are used throughout the book and that you'd probably rather not type in. Highly recommended for anyone who really wants to use UNIX, and not just cower or pose.</p>age that is the ultimate &#34;tips and techniques&#34; book for the Unix operating system.

Ever wished <i>you</i> could recreate one of these fabulous restaurants' dishes in your own kitchen? Michael Bauer, esteemed food critic for the <i>San Francisco Chronicle,</i> has spent years twisting the arms of the Bay Area's best chef's for the secrets to their signature dishes. Now they're all collected in <i>The Secrets of Success Cookbook.</i> Filled with anecdotes, insider tips and techniques, plus over 300 great recipes from all over the Bay Area, this must-have book will help you dazzle your dinner guests from the first course to the last. Where it's a spoonful of cocoa powder in Bistro Jeanty's Coq au Vin or the double-baking technique for Zax's Goat Cheese Souffle, <i>The Secrets of Success Cookbook</i> offers the inside scoop on bringing the taste of Northern California's most-prized culinary delights home to your own table.</p><p>The Book of Kells, one of the great illuminated manuscripts, sits in the library of Trinity College in Dublin, a new page daily revealed to the public. You could do much the same with Michael Bauer's <i>The Secrets of Success Cookbook</i> in your kitchen, displaying a new and wonderful signature recipe from a San Francisco restaurant each day for 300 days. Imagine. You would start with Parmesan Budinis with Warm Asparagus and Pea Shoots from Acquerello, learning the secrets of baking a successful custard, and end with an Apple Galette from Zax wherein the secret of success consists of unsalted butter and chilled dough.<p> As a food and restaurant critic for the <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>, Michael Bauer has had ample opportunity to take a note or two about the kinds of dishes that make one restaurant stand out from another, the so-called signature dish. It would be one thing to cajole Bay Area chefs into sharing their recipes and making certain those commercial recipes actually work in a home kitchen. But Bauer takes it one step farther: He ferrets out the successful technique behind each dish. Who in their right mind would go to all the time and trouble to preserve lemons for a dish like Moroccan Game Hens with Preserved Lemons and Olives as served at Kasbah? Well, it turns out that what normally takes a month can take a week if you freeze the lemons and add salt--so why not give it a try?</p><p> Bauer introduces each recipe with detailed notes about the chef and restaurant as well as baseline information about the actual dish. Recipe instructions have been pared down to the essentials. A Secrets of Success sidebar accompanies each recipe. The difficulty comes with page after page after page of deliciousness. Where to start? What to try next? Will you start with the Grand Caf� recipe for Polenta Souffl� with Mushroom Sauce? Or what about Bradley Ogden's Potato Skins with Smoked Salmon and Horseradish Cr�me Fraiche from the Lark Creek Inn? Baronda's Mixed Green Salad with Grapefruit and Warm Shrimp certainly looks good. So does the Seared Black Pepper Lavender Fillet of Beef from Caf� la Haye. The list is 300 recipes deep. One a day would take you through the better part of a year. And what a year <i>that</i> would be. <i>--Schuyler Ingle</i></p>Michael Bauer has been a food journalist for more than 15 years and has been the editor of the San Francisco Chronicle food section for 10 years.</p><h2>The BMW Century: The Ultimate Performance Machines</h2><p><p><b>2017 Silver Medal&nbsp;Winner of the International&nbsp;Automotive Media Competition!&nbsp;</b><br><br> Relive the first one hundred years of Germany's best two- and four-wheeled rides.</p><p>Established in 1916, BMW is one of the auto and motorcycle industry's oldest and most-respected car and motorcycle manufacturers. Over the past century, the company went through myriad developments. <i>The BMW Century</i> chronicles this remarkable transportation company through images of the cars and motorcycles it manufactured, from the 1923 R32 motorcycle to sleek electric cars of today. This handsome volume is filled with images, history, and in-depth looks at the incredible machines BMW created year after year.</p><p><i>The BMW Century </i>showcases how the company's new visionary team systematically rebuilt BMW in the post-World War II years into the spectacular success we know today - that is, a company with sales projected to be upwards of two million cars annually by 2016, led by its 3-series, the best-selling luxury-performance car in the world.</p><p>BMW's motorcycle division is no less legendary. It began with the 1923 avant-garde R32, which featured a 180-degree, horizontally opposed twin, the engine configuration that would become BMW's hallmark. Along the way, BMW would use that configuration to power groundbreaking machines like the R90S, R100RS, and R80GS. Beginning in 1983, they would add three- and four-cylinder machines to their offerings, culminating in today's spectacular S1000RR sport bike.</p><p>From the pre-war motorcycles to the iconic R-series twins of the 1970s and 80s to the mighty M-series cars and superbikes of today, <i>The BMW Century</i> offers a full review of German engineering at its finest.

What begins where architecture ends? What was before architecture? The ostensible subject of Ann Cline's inquiry is the primitive hut, a one-room structure built of common or rustic materials. Does the proliferation of these structures in recent times represent escapist architectural fantasy, or deeper cultural impulses? As she addresses this question, Cline gracefully weaves together two stories: one of primitive huts in times of cultural transition, and the other of diminutive structures in our own time of architectural transition. From these narrative strands emerges a deeper inquiry: what are the limits of architecture? What ghosts inhabit its edges? What does it mean to dwell outside it? Cline's project began twenty-five years ago, when she set out to translate the Japanese tea ritual into an American idiom. First researching the traditional tea practices of Japan, then building and designing huts in the United States, she attempted to make the "translation" from one culture to another through the use of common American building materials and technology. But her investigation eventually led her to look at many nonarchitectural ideas and sources, for the hut exists both at the beginning of and at the farthest edge of architecture, in the margins between what architecture is and what it is not. In the resulting narrative, she blends autobiography, historical research, and cultural criticism to consider the place that such structures as shacks, teahouses, follies, casitas, and diners&#x2015;simple, "undesigned" places valued for their timelessness and authenticity&#x2015;occupy from both a historical and contemporary perspective. This book is an original and imaginative attempt to rethink architecture by studying its boundary conditions and formative structures.</p></p><p>Subtitled <i>Life Outside the Circle of Architecture</i>, this book takes "a stroll through the borderlands that surround architecture" to bestow a quiet nobility on huts, shacks, shanties, teahouses, follies, and casitas. Writer Ann Cline is a professor of "capital-<i>A</i> Architecture," as she proffers in an up-front confession. But she has built and occupied a hut, and her thoughts on what she terms "life in the margins" are illuminating. In one example, she reveals that in "the years I had gazed out at a row of pomegranate trees at the rear of my yard, I never knew overripe pomegranates sometimes burst open. Reading in my hut one autumn evening, the sudden sound of a pomegranate cracking open riveted my attention."<p> "Everyone knows what 'the hut' stands for," Cline writes. She references the solitary St. Anthony, Lady Chatterly, and Heidi in three successive sentences and quickly moves on to Po-I and Shu-chi, "the world's first recorded recluses," and Lao Tzu, who "recommended refuge" in troubled times. </p><p> Cline's prose waxes wordy when she forays into art criticism, but at her best she writes with tender understanding about shack builders and dwellers: the mentally ill, the urban homeless, children in playhouses, and the Japanese wabi, who are drawn to a rustic life and who transform poverty into simplicity, a virtue, and a blessing. Some of her ideas may ring bells for readers who loved such counterculture staples as <i>Handmade Houses: The Woodbutcher's Art</i>, or such celebrations of simplicity as <i>Tiny, Tiny Houses</i>. But Cline's book is infinitely broader than either of those, although lacking their visual pleasures (all the photographs are small black-and-whites). <i>A Hut of One's Own</i> is a thinker's book, with a place on both the architecture and philosophy shelves, but thinker-builders should be entranced by it too. <i>--Peggy Moorman</i></p>Ann Cline is Associate Professor of Architecture at Miami University, Oxford, Ohio.</p><h2>Worlds Away: New Suburban Landscapes</h2><p>The suburbs have always been a fertile space for imagining both the best and the worst of modern social life. Portrayed alternately as a middle-class domestic utopia and a dystopic world of homogeneity and conformity--with manicured suburban lawns and the inchoate darkness that lurks just beneath the surface--these stereotypes belie a more realistic understanding of contemporary suburbia and its dynamic transformations. Organized by the Walker Art Center in association with the Heinz Architectural Center at Carnegie Museum of Art, <i>Worlds Away: New Suburban Landscapes</i> is the first major museum exhibition to examine both the art and architecture of the contemporary American suburb. Featuring paintings, photographs, prints, architectural models, sculptures and video from more than 30 artists and architects, including Christopher Ballantyne, Center for Land Use Interpretation, Gregory Crewdson, Estudio Teddy Cruz, Dan Graham and Larry Sultan, <i>Worlds Away</i> demonstrates the catalytic role of the American suburb in the creation of new art and prospective architecture. Conceived as a revisionist and even contrarian take on the conventional wisdom surrounding suburban life, the catalogue features new essays and seminal writings by John Archer, Robert Beuka, Robert Breugmann, David Brooks, Beatriz Colomina, Malcolm Gladwell and others, as well as a lexicon of suburban neologisms.</p><p></p><h2>Research Methods for Business: A Skill Building Approach</h2><p><i>Research Methods for Business: A Skill Building Approach,5th Edition</i> is a concise and straightforward introduction for students to the world of business research.

The popularity of the sport led to the establishment of the Professional Mexican Baseball League in 1925, which continues today. <p> This text opens with a brief history of Mexican professional baseball and provides, in both English and Spanish, statistical information on the players of the Mexican Baseball League since 1937 (the first year in which the league kept official records).

Under the command of the eunuch admiral Zheng He, fleets of more than three hundred "treasure ships" - some measuring as much as 400 feet long, with crews of 28,000 men - made seven epic voyages through the China Seas and the Indian Ocean. Unrivaled in size until the invasion fleets of World War I, the fleets traveled from Taiwan to the Red Sea, down the east coast of Africa, China's El Dorado, and perhaps even to Australia, three hundred years before Captain Cook's "discovery."<br>Bearing a costly cargo of the Ming empire's finest silks, porcelains, and lacquerware, the treasure fleets ventured forth ready to trade with all who recognized the authority of the dragon throne, occupied at the time by the ambitious Zhu Di, who also built Beijing's Forbidden City. Far more than mere commercial missions, however, the expeditions churned up political and cultural currents in southeast Asia and precipitated the diaspora of the Chinese throughout the Indian Ocean basin.<br>Half the world was thus in China's grasp, and the rest could easily have been, had the emperor so wished. But instead China turned inward, resulting in the rapid demise of its navy and the loss of its technological and scientific edge over Europe. As had happened many times before in the country's history - and has happened many times since - the gates that had swung so wide clanged shut, and China's period of greatest expansion was followed by that of its greatest isolation.<br>When China Ruled the Seas is popular history at its best. Drawing on new translations of eye-witness accounts and official Ming histories, and including dozens of vivid illustrations, this is the first full account of one of the most colorful chapters in China's past and its sudden, enigmatic end.</p><p><br><strong>Louise Levathes</strong> was a staff writer for <em>National Geographic</em> for ten years and writes for <em>The New York Times</em>, <em>The Washington Post</em>, and other publications. In 1990, she was a visiting scholar at The Johns Hopkins Center for Chinese and American Studies at Nanjing University, Jiangsu, China. She lives in Washington, D.C.<br>Levathes, a former staff writer for National Geographic, tells the tale of Chinese emperor Zhu Di and his favorite eunuch admiral, Zheng He, who tried during a 30-year period to break China's isolation with seven major naval expeditions to India, Indonesia, and Africa. Levathes writes popular history and therefore sprinkles her text with scene-setting and little digressions into everyday life in Ming China. The descriptions of the giant naval docks at Longjiang are fascinating, as is her account of the eternal intrigues between the eunuch faction and the Confucian bureaucracy at court. The eunuchs and merchants wanted trade, exploration, and capital venture; the Confucians wanted moderate taxes, isolation, and priority given to agriculture. The struggle between these outlooks dominated--and still dominates--China's dealings with the outside world. Zhu Di was with the merchants, and his fleets were veritable mercantile armadas, with boachuan (treasure boats) 400 feet long. Their principal destination was Calicut in Kerala, the only state that the Chinese did not regard as barbarian. From here they brought back spices, elephants, and the first eyeglasses from Venice. Having established Chinese domination of the Indian Ocean, Zheng seemed to be on the brink of ushering in an era of global Chinese imperialism and openness to the outside world. It was not to be. Zhu Di died in 1424 and was succeeded by his son Gaozhi, a devout Confucian who banned all naval voyages. A hundred years later, China had no navy and anyone caught even sailing on the high seas was summarily put to death. Levathes illuminates a historical crossroads: the century in which Western and Chinese expansion overlapped. She does not fully explain why one continued and the other did not, but she does expose one piece of the historical jigsaw puzzle, namely the root of the Chinese inability to open a door to the outside world. She does this entertainingly and with a minimum of dry analysis. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Hicks deliberately and provocatively engages what are often considered mutually exclusive domains, rethinking and pushing the limits of generally accepted contexts, conditions, and frameworks. These include distinct objects and temporal, performative actions; studio works and commissions for public buildings; and textiles made in artisanal workshops as well as for industrial production in places as different as Chile, France, Germany, India, Japan, Mexico, Morocco, Sweden, and the United States.</p><p>Three essays&nbsp;analyze the progression of Hicks&#x2019;s art and technique and her many modes of working.

Just as quality film photos by serious photographers were finished in the chemical darkroom, serious digital photographers---almost without exception---include working in the digital darkroom as part of their workflow. </p> <p> When I give a workshop or in-person presentation of my work someone nearly always raises their hand and asks, "Was that 'Photoshopped'?" </p> <p> My response is, "Yes. And with my work the answer will always be 'Yes'." </p> <p> I am not alone in using Photoshop as part of my work. In fact, whether they will publicly admit it or not, almost every professional or serious amateur photographer uses Photoshop or other post-production software to enhance their work. The question is not whether it is used. The question is simply whether the tools of digital post-production are used skillfully. </p> <p> So if you are looking for a photography book that will tell you how to get it right without using the digital darkroom, <em>The Way of the Digital Photographer</em> is not for you. By the way, it never was possible to get it right without involving post-production. For example, Ansel Adams put huge effort into manipulating his images long after they had left the camera to make his wonderful prints. Digital photography is best when photography and Photoshop work together! </p> <p> Photography begins with creativity and vision. But without mastery of craft, creativity and vision by themselves will never amount to much. If you are ready to really learn the craft of digital photography, and looking for a photography book with thorough, detailed and specific instructions on becoming a better digital image maker, then <em>The Way of the Digital Photographer</em> is written for you! </p> <p> Starting with the building blocks of creative post-production such as layers, layer masking, and blending modes, I will show you how to approach designing a personal digital workflow to enhance your work and move it in new directions. I also show you how to "finish" digital photos using tools such as LAB color adjustments, filters, backgrounds and textures. </p> <p> As a photographer, you also need to internalize the impact of the digital darkroom when you make photos...and bring this knowledge back in a rigorous and intuitive way into the process of photography itself. No matter what photographic hardware you use -- from iPhone to DSLR -- I will show you how to be a technically more accomplished photographer in the digital era, while not losing the creative spirit that got you into photography in the first place. </p> <p> When I wear my hat as a photography educator and writer, my greatest pleasure is teaching new techniques, and helping others find the sources of their own creativity. Please join me on <em>The Way of the Digital Photographer</em>, and may the photographic force be with you! </p> <br> <br> <p><b>Example Photos and Commentary</b></p> <p><b>Flowers of Late Summer</b></p> <p> Dahlias tend to bloom later than the other flowers in my garden, so I enjoyed the opportunity to photograph these end-of-summer blossoms on my light box. After creating an image of the flowers with a white background, I added them to a background and used a texture effect to cut the "harshness" of the background and create a pleasing overall image. </p> <p> Exposure and processing information: 35mm, six exposures at shutter speeds ranging from 10 seconds to 1/10 of a second, all exposures at f/13 and ISO 100, tripod mounted; exposures combined using Nik HDR Efex Pro and hand-HDR in Adobe Camera RAW and Photoshop; I also added a scanned paper background and light texturize overlay to this version. </p> <p><b>Just So</b></p> <p> On an overcast, gray day, I took the RER (R�seau Express R�gional) out of central Paris to the suburb of Bourg-la-Reine. From the train station in Bourg-la-Reine I carried my gear the mile or so to the Parc de Sceaux (pronounced "Park de So"). The Parc de Sceaux is a less-well-known masterpiece of landscape design by Andr� Le N�tre, the seventeenth-century landscape architect of Louis XIV responsible for the gardens at Versaille, the Tuilleries, and other famous formal French gardens. </p> <p> As I explored the area, my concern was that the looming clouds might turn to rain, making photography difficult. But as I approached the long channel of water that radiated across the width of the gardens in a cross formation, the clouds parted and the sun emerged, making the reflections just so...beautiful! </p> <p> This image is a composite blend of five exposures. Each exposure was shot using a 35mm lens on my full-frame camera at f/11 and ISO 100, with shutter speeds ranging from 1/30 of a second to 1/500 of a second. I used a circular polarizer to enhance the reflections, and combined the exposures in Photoshop using layers and masking. </p> <br> <br> <p><b>Bixby Bridge by Starlight</b></p> <p> Over the years, I&#x2019;ve enjoyed photographing the dramatic Bixby Bridge on the Big Sur coast of California at night, and it is always fun to take a workshop group to this location. Getting out of the car, it is hard at first to see much in the inky blackness except that it is a long way down to the Pacific Ocean. As things resolve, it becomes clear that one can create interesting images, provided one keeps the camera open long enough, since there really isn&#x2019;t much light. But in this case the camera sees more than we do! </p> <p> Exposure and processing information: Nikon D800, Zeiss 15mm f/2.8 lens, ten exposures, each exposure at four minutes, f/2.8 and ISO 500, tripod mounted; exposures stacked using the Photoshop CC Statistics script, enhanced using LAB color adjustments. </p> <br> <br> <p><b>La Tour Eiffel</b></p> <p> At night, the area under the Eiffel Tower turns into an exciting display of lights, colors and people -- as you can see in this iPhone shot of this small carousel beneath the Eiffel Tower, the king of all amusement park rides! </p> <p> iPhone 4 captured using the Slow Shutter app, with colors enhanced using the FilterStorm for iPhone app. </p>Harold Davis is an award-winning professional photographer whose work is widely admired and collected.

P. Lovecarft, here are nearly sixty unforgettable stories that ignore the confines of space and time to offer, among other times and places: a cabinet of curiosities in contemporary Cairo, an alchemical ceiling in 18th-century Naples, the hallucinatory inner worlds of psychotics, anthropomorphic planets, and an Old West ruled by necromancy. Thirty of these tales were published in a limited edition by a small Canadian publisher in 1980. This expanded, revised edition collects the complete short stories of one of the most imaginative writers of our time.</p><p>Rikki Ducornet was born in New York and has lived in North Africa, South America, Canada and France. Her work as an illustrator first came to the attention of the Canadian book trade in 1974 with the publication of Susan Musgrave's "Gullband". In 1983, the Porcupine's Quill commissioned Rikki to illustrate an edition of Jorge Luis Borges' "Tlon, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius".<p>Rikki is the author of three short-story collections, seven books of poetry, and seven novels, including "The Fan-Maker's Inquisition" and "The Jade Cabinet". She is also a painter whose work has been exhibited widely. She currently lives in Denver, Colorado.</p>From illustrator-author Ducornet (The Jade Cabinet, 1993, etc.), nearly 60 stories, some previously published--Iowa Review, Canadian Fiction Magazine, etc.--that resemble a vitrine stuffed with curiosities, grotesqueries, and erotic paraphernalia. Written with great verve and a tirelessly original imagination, these tales, though often quite brilliant in their evocation of an individual sensation or idea, cumulatively pall, if not exhaust. Many only a page or two long, a rare few explore more fully Ducornet's preoccupations with religious hypocrisy, sexual repression, and metamorphosis. In the ``Nipple,'' a middle-aged man whose mother has just died decides to marry but then finds all the comfort he needs in a bachelor-party gift of a baby-bottle; in ``Luggage,'' a grieving widower goes on a shopping spree, then says of his wife that ``by dying you have ripened me and deepened me, and in your own wifely and cunning way you led me to the weekend bag'' that will hold all his new purchases; and in ``Bazar,'' set in North Africa, a repressed homosexual who believes ``his life has no other object but spiritual progress'' tries to forget that he has seduced and murdered a young Arab boy. Other long stories are ``Missy'' (a psychotic little girl enacts the symbolic death of a schoolmate by eviscerating and quartering Gossey, ``a small brown, rabbittish'' toy) and ``Outer Space'' (Boo tries to foresee his disturbed mother's moods yet also lead a normal childhood). Memorable shorter tales include ``The Double''--a woman grows a companion from her own severed feet; ``Parasites''--a madman is obsessed with parasites; and ``Grace''--another woman is consoled by the memory of her hair being plaited. With their relentless emphasis on the bizarre, the nasty, and the surreal, tales that provoke and disturb--but generally remain little more than cleverly executed curiosities. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

World expert Henry Cleere concentrates on the rich archaeological heritage of this region, from the cave art of the Paleolithic period, when our ancestors were decorating caves and rock shelters with dramatic depictions of hunting and ritual, through the end of Roman Gaul, visiting such tourist centers as Carcassonne, Arles, Avignon, Provence, and Nice.<br> <br> After being annexed by Rome in the 2nd century BC, the prosperous new province was endowed with many fine public buildings, such as the amphitheaters and theaters at Arles, N�mes, and Orange, the network of roads, and massive town walls. In addition, these areas offer a wealth of information about everyday life, such as the water mill at Barb�gal, the potteries of La Graufesenque, and the houses of the town dwellers at Vaison-la-Romaine. Complete with maps, listings of museums, suggestions for further reading, and extensive coverage of sites, Southern France is the perfect guide for tourists and lovers of archaeology alike.</p><p>The mountainous regions of southern France, historian Fernand Braudel observed, were settled earlier and more heavily than most other regions in the Mediterranean. The coastal town of Lattes, writes British archaeologist Cleere by way of example, has been settled since the early Neolithic, or nearly six millennia, its inhabitants then as now drawn by its handsome lagoons and fertile fields.<p> Cleere describes 104 sites in the region, from the Gironde to the Maritime Alps, keying directions to the Michelin 1:200,000 series of maps. A few of those sites will be well known to travelers with an interest in ancient history: the Maison Carr�e and the fine Roman arena at Nimes, for instance, or the great amphitheater at Arles. Other sites are less well known but of great historical significance, such as the stone hill forts on the Plateau de Jastres where the Arveni chieftain Vercingetorix suffered defeat at the hands of Julius Caesar, and the great limestone caverns at Le Mas d'Azil, where magnificent examples of late Magdalenian period cave art have been found. The book is illustrated with high-quality photographs, maps, architectural plans, and line drawings, and accompanied by sidebars explaining points of historical and cultural interest. This includes, for example, notes on the eerie Celtic "severed head cult" and the development of the Aretine pottery industry in southern France.</p><p> The book makes a splendid companion for travelers seeking a window into the ancient past, one that will take them away from the crowds and into little-explored country. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p><br><strong>Henry Cleere</strong> has been a consultant to the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS) in Paris since 1992, coordinating its work as advisor on cultural heritage to the UNESCO World Heritage Committee.

The fundamental issue it addresses is the proper balance between syntax and semantics, between structure and derivation, and between rule systems and lexicon. It argues that the balance struck by mainstream generative grammar is wrong. It puts forward a new basis for syntactic theory, drawing on a wide range of frameworks, and charts new directions for research. <br> In the past four decades, theories of syntactic structure have become more abstract, and syntactic derivations have become ever more complex. Peter Culicover and Ray Jackendoff trace this development through the history of contemporary syntactic theory, showing how much it has been driven by theory-internal rather than empirical considerations. They develop an alternative that is responsive to linguistic, cognitive, computational, and biological concerns. <br> <br> <em>Simpler Syntax</em> is addressed to linguists of all persuasions. It will also be of central interest to those concerned with language in psychology, human biology, evolution, computational science, and artificial intelligence.<br></p><p><br><strong>Peter W.

It should prove thought-provoking not just for scholars working within generative linguistics, for whom it will provide many novel and insightful solutions to some very old questions within that paradigm, but also for linguists from outside the generative tradition, who will find in it one of the very few historically and applicationally contextualised accounts of the preoccupations of generative linguistics."--<em>Linguist List 17.718</em><p></p><br>"This book is a major step forward for linguistics.

In the Mo-ho chih-kuan (Great calming, contemplation), an extraordinarily comprehensive treatise on the theory and practice of meditation, the revered master sets forth the "perfect and sudden" approach to Buddhahood, a distinctively East Asian conception of the Buddhist path regarded by Chih-i and his contemporaries as the epitome of the Buddha's teaching. In many ways Chih-i's systematization of Chinese Buddhist meditation practice led the way to the development of Ch'an (Zen) and Pure Land. Such an illustrious history and catholicity of appeal secure it a place alongside Buddhagosa's Visuddhimagga and Tsong-kha-pa's Lam-rim chen-mo as one of the great classics of Buddhist spirituality.<br>The original text of the Mo-ho chih-kuan consists of ten main chapters distributed over ten fascicles - the equivalent of four or five volumes in English. The translation of the first chapter is offered here together with the influential preface composed by Chih-i's disciple Kuan-ting (561-632), the man responsible for recording and editing the work. Known as the Synopsis, this chapter rehearses in condensed form the basic structure and thematic content of the Mo-ho chih-kuan as a whole. Because of the self-contained character of this chapter, T'ien-t'ai exegetes have treated it almost as a work unto itself; it contains an important and influential exposition of the Four Forms of Samadhi (not contained in the body of the text). The annotation provided in this volume draws from the authoritative commentary by Chan-jan (711-782). Scholars of Buddhism, most especially the T'ien-t'ai tradition, will appreciate the availability in English of this important work.</p><p></p><h2>Bottled Lightning: Superbatteries, Electric Cars, and the New Lithium Economy</h2><p><p>The sleek electronic tools that have become so ubiquitous&#x2014;laptops, iPods, eReaders, and smart phones&#x2014;are all powered by lithium batteries. Chances are you&#x2019;ve got some lithium on your person right now. But aside from powering a mobile twenty first-century lifestyle, the third element on the periodic table may also hold the key to an environmentally sustainable, oil-independent future. From electric cars to a &#x201c;smart&#x201d; power grid that can actually store electricity, letting us harness the powers of the sun and the wind and use them when we need them, lithium&#x2014;a metal half as dense as water, created in the first minutes after the Big Bang and found primarily in some of the most uninhabitable places on earth&#x2014;is the key to setting us on a path toward a low-carbon energy future. It&#x2019;s also shifting the geopolitical chessboard in profound ways. <br><br>In <i>Bottled Lightning</i>, the science reporter Seth Fletcher takes us on a fascinating journey, from the salt flats of Bolivia to the labs of MIT and Stanford, from the turmoil at GM to cutting-edge lithium-ion battery start-ups, introducing us to the key players and ideas in an industry with the power to reshape the world. Lithium is the thread that ties together many key stories of our time: the environmental movement; the American auto industry, staking its revival on the electrification of cars and trucks; the struggle between first-world countries in need of natural resources and the impoverished countries where those resources are found; and the overwhelming popularity of the portable, Internet-connected gadgets that are changing the way we communicate. With nearly limitless possibilities, the promise of lithium offers new hope to a foundering American economy desperately searching for a green-tech boom to revive it.</p></p><p><p>Seth Fletcher is a senior editor at <i>Popular Science</i> magazine.

He lives in Brooklyn.</p>1THE ELECTRICIANSBefore the invention of the battery in the first year of the nineteenth century, electricity as we know it today&#x2014;as a stream of electrons that can be made to do our bidding&#x2014;didn&#x2019;t exist. Electricity was part parlor trick, part mystery. It was a fuzzy force field that could be conjured by rubbing a plate of glass with fur. It was in no way useful, and it wasn&#x2019;t even remotely understood. Only after the battery gave mankind a reliable source of electricity did that really begin to change.We&#x2019;ve known about what is now called static electricity since around 600 B.C., when the Greek philosopher Thales of Miletus began puzzling over a strange property of amber: when rubbed with cloth, amber (called <i>elektron</i> in Greek) would, through some invisible mechanism, pull feathers toward itself. The phenomenon resembled magnetism, which the Greeks had observed in iron-bearing stones found near the city of Magnesia on the Meander. After Thales, however, more than two millennia would pass before human understanding of these two forces advanced appreciably. At the beginning of the seventeenth century, some momentum returned when William Gilbert, chief doctor to Queen Elizabeth I of England, discovered that a variety of materials could be electrified by friction, just like amber. Gilbert is the one who coined the word &#x201c;electricity,&#x201d; drawing on the Greek word for amber to give a name to the force that he called &#x201c;electrical effluvia.&#x201d; After that, in part because there was no good way to store electricity for use in experiments, the &#x201c;electrickal arts&#x201d; progressed only haltingly for the next century and a half.Then came the Leyden jar. Invented in the town of Leyden, Belgium, in the 1740s, it was literally a jar for electricity. Its walls coated inside and out with metal, the jar was filled with water and then, via a metal chain that dangled down through the lid, charged by an electrostatic machine. (We now know that the Leyden jar is a capacitor, a device that stores charge between a pair of conductors.) One Leyden jar, or several of them wired in series, could hold a significant charge, as Benjamin Franklin learned around Christmas in 1750, when he accidentally hit himself with a charge he&#x2019;d been building up to kill a holiday turkey. He called it a &#x201c;universal blow&#x201d; through the body, which left &#x201c;a numbness in my arms and the back of my neck which continued til the next morning but wore off.&#x201d; Yet the Leyden jar&#x2019;s usefulness was limited by the fact that it could dump its charge only in that kind of instantaneous jolt. This restricted the kinds of experiments scientists&#x2014;or, as they often referred to themselves, electricians&#x2014;could perform, and by the second half of the eighteenth century the true nature of electricity was still a mystery. In 1752, when Franklin performed his legendary kite experiment and determined that the electricity generated by friction was the same stuff as lightning, it was an important breakthrough. But what was <i>that</i> common force? No one knew.<br>&nbsp;The battery was the accidental fruit of a dispute between two Italian scientists over this question. In one corner was Luigi Galvani, a physician at the University of Bologna, who noticed that under certain circumstances, touching a scalpel to the crural nerves in the thigh of a dissected frog caused the legs to kick to life. Galvani came to believe that within the muscles of all living creatures flows an electrical fluid, an &#x201c;indwelling electricity&#x201d; generated by the brain and pumped through the body as a motivating force.In the other corner was Alessandro Giuseppe Antonio Anastasio Volta, a professor of physics at the University of Pavia. Volta had long been interested in the general project of eliminating superstition through the careful study of phenomena still commonly attributed to magic. He thought deeply about the concepts of mind and the soul, and for a while he entertained Galvani&#x2019;s theory as a possible explanation for the relationship between the &#x201c;will&#x201d; and the motion of the body. But that didn&#x2019;t last long. Through his research with electrical instruments he became convinced that there was no such thing as animal electricity. Instead, electricity was set in motion by the contact of different metals. When a disembodied frog leg kicks in the presence of electricity, that&#x2019;s because it&#x2019;s a good conductor, just like the human tongue, one of Volta&#x2019;s favorite experimental tools.Galvani and Volta sparred over the nature of electricity for years beginning in 1792, trading jabs in letters and books. A decisive round began in 1797, when Galvani published a long book devoted to destroying Volta&#x2019;s theory of metallic electricity. Volta could easily handle all of Galvani&#x2019;s arguments but one, which involved a freak of nature that seemed to validate everything Galvani believed in: the torpedo fish, a bottom-dwelling ray conveniently equipped with an organ capable of creating electrical shocks strong enough to kill a man. Galvani believed that some kind of electrical fluid was cooked up in the fish&#x2019;s brain and then piped throughout its nervous system, and he intended to prove it experimentally.Volta knew that the torpedo fish threat had to be dispatched quickly. He learned how to do so when he read a paper by the English chemist William Nicholson, which proposed that the torpedo fish produced electricity not through its brain, nerves, or will, but through an organ that could be modeled mechanically. Volta ran with Nicholson&#x2019;s idea, determined to build a device that would draw electricity only from the contact of different metals. After only a few months he emerged from his lab with a column of little sandwich cookies, each one a zinc and copper disc separated by brine-soaked cardboard. On March 20, 1800, Volta wrote to Sir Joseph Banks of the Royal Society in England, announcing his discovery of &#x201c;electricity excited by the mere mutual contact of different kinds of metal.&#x201d; The battery had arrived.News of the battery spread across Europe as quickly as the infrastructure of the day would allow. Letters describing the new device sailed to England, France, Denmark. Electricians throughout Europe began replicating Volta&#x2019;s experiment, and soon they began building larger and more powerful batteries. Nicholson built one and used it to create what the historian Giuliano Pancaldi described as &#x201c;loud detonations, clouds of bubbles, gleams of light, shocks felt by up to nine people holding each other by the hand, and a ramified metallic vegetation, nine or ten times the bulk of the wire, when the wire was kept in the circuit of the battery for four hours.&#x201d; Almost immediately the battery enabled major fundamental scientific discoveries. Within weeks, Nicholson and his colleague Anthony Carlisle had used the battery to break water down into hydrogen and oxygen, proving that water was not, in fact, an irreducible element.Volta called his invention the &#x201c;organe electrique artificial.&#x201d; Nicholson called the device the &#x201c;pile,&#x201d; referring to the fact that it is simply a pile of metal and cardboard. Soon, however, the word &#x201c;battery&#x201d; emerged in common usage, a reference to the practice of connecting a &#x201c;battery&#x201d; of Leyden jars in series to supply electricity.The battery assured Volta a place in the pantheon. It was &#x201c;the last great discovery made with the instruments, concepts, and methods of the eighteenth-century electricians,&#x201d; a device that &#x201c;opened up a limitless field&#x201d; that &#x201c;transformed our civilization,&#x201d; wrote the historian John L. Heilbron. The nineteenth-century physicist Michael Faraday, often considered the most brilliant experimentalist in history, called the battery a &#x201c;magnificent instrument of philosophic research.&#x201d; Auguste Comte, the founder of positivist philosophy, called Volta &#x201c;immortal&#x201d; and put him on the <i>Positivist Calendar</i>, a proposed reform calendar that celebrated history&#x2019;s greatest thinkers. According to the historian of science George Sarton, the battery &#x201c;opened to man a new and incomparable source of energy.&#x201d;Volta earned such effusive praise because of the battery&#x2019;s enduring, history-bending influence. Throughout the nineteenth century, the battery powered the experiments that finally allowed human beings to put to work the amber-borne force field that had mystified thinkers for millennia. The famed English chemist Humphry Davy used large batteries to break various minerals into previously unknown elements&#x2014;potassium, sodium, magnesium, calcium, barium, strontium. In Copenhagen in 1820, Hans Christian Oersted noticed while giving a lecture that current flowing from a battery changed the direction of a compass that was sitting nearby. Soon, Oersted proved that electricity could induce magnetism. Oersted&#x2019;s discovery led to James Clerk Maxwell&#x2019;s equations describing the relationship between electricity and magnetism&#x2014;electromagnetism&#x2014;which led to the electric motor, the generator, the telephone, and every other electrically powered device ever invented.By the middle of the nineteenth century, the battery found use outside the lab, primarily as a power source for the telegraph. As the battery steadily improved, its uses grew. In 1859, the French physicist Gaston Plant� achieved a major breakthrough: the first practical rechargeable battery, a primitive version of the lead-acid cells we still use to start our gas-powered cars. In 1881, the French chemical engineer Camille Alphonse Faure came up with a practical method for manufacturing lead-acid batteries. Soon a shady bunch of European patent scavengers and stock manipulators were trying to get rich on Faure&#x2019;s invention, inflating the small-scale equivalent of a nineteenth-century dot-com bubble, and temporarily giving the battery business a bad reputation. But that didn&#x2019;t stop the spread of the new technology. By the beginning of the twentieth century, lead-acid batteries were widely used to power telegraphs, manage the electrical load in electricallighting substations, and support electrical streetcar networks. By then, many of them were also driving cars.<br>&nbsp;At the beginning of the automobile age, cars powered by gasoline, electricity, and steam all shared the road, and none was an obvious winner. Actually, electric cars had a strong early advantage. They were clean, quiet, and civilized. Gas-powered cars were unreliable, complicated, loud, and dirty. They could be started only with a firm turn of the starting crank, and when that crank backfired it was extremely effective at breaking arms. When they weren&#x2019;t breaking down or inflicting pain, however, gas-powered cars offered something that electric cars couldn&#x2019;t&#x2014;decent driving range, extendable within minutes with a tin of gasoline from the general store.Thomas Edison loved the idea of the electric car. Electric cars were a natural, stabilizing, money-generating appendage to the electrical network he had spent his career building. Widespread adoption of the electric car would help sustain his direct current (DC) standard, because charging a battery from an alternating-current (AC) network required an additional piece of equipment, an AC-DC converter. He knew that battery technology would determine whether electric cars would thrive or lose out to the rapidly improving gas-powered car, and he happened to be looking for a new conquest. He had already made, lost, and remade a fortune&#x2014;already invented the stock ticker, the lightbulb, the phonograph, and the motion picture. He had just closed down a disastrous attempt at mining iron ore in western New Jersey. And so in 1898, he began studying the literature on battery research, the first step in a quest that would dominate the next eleven years of his life.The battery project was a departure for him. For years he had railed against &#x201c;storage batteries,&#x201d; as rechargeables were called. He saw them as catalysts for corruption, the tools of scam artists. Now he was committed to bringing the technology into a new, respectable age, and he was confident that he would succeed. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think Nature would be so <i>unkind</i> as to withhold the secret of a good storage battery, if a real earnest hunt were made for it,&#x201d; he wrote to a friend. He had no idea what he was getting himself into.Edison&#x2019;s goal was to create a new battery that would triple the capacity of the most advanced lead-acid batteries of his day. He wanted to surpass lead acid by ditching both the lead and the acid, finding new metals and electrolytes that could build a battery that was not only more energetic but also longer-lived. Part of the reason for his choice of materials was that he believed an alkaline rather than acidic electrolyte would be necessary to build a lighter and longer-lived battery. But he was also competing against the market-leading Electric Storage Battery (ESB) Company of Philadelphia, which was owned by the New York tycoon William C. Whitney, and which controlled most of the patents on lead-acid batteries. Edison couldn&#x2019;t chase them on their own wellestablished road. He would have to find a different approach.The romantic telling of this period of Edison&#x2019;s life has the proudly anti-academic inventor scorning theory and, instead, systematically churning through every conceivably suitable substance&#x2014;innumerable grades and forms of copper, iron, cadmium, cobalt, magnesium, nickel hydrate, along with any number of formulations of the electrolyte. As his biographer Matthew Josephson wrote, &#x201c;The number of experiments mounted into the hundreds, then to the thousands; at over ten thousand, Edison said, &#x2018;they turned the register back to zero and started over again.&#x2019; A year, eighteen months went by, and they had not even a clue.&#x201d;In reality, he was not working blindly. He knew the literature. He was probably building on research conducted by scientists such as the Swedish chemist Waldemar Jungner, who had been doing pioneering work on alkaline batteries himself. Edison was also probably spying on his competition at ESB, which was racing to develop an improved lead-acid battery called the Exide.Because of the intensity of the competition with ESB, almost as soon as Edison chose a basic design for his battery he began promoting it. In 1902, he wrote an article for the <i>North American Review</i> reporting that his lab work had led him to &#x201c;the final perfection of the storage battery,&#x201d; a cell that used nickel and iron electrodes and a potassium-based electrolyte. He had his critics. In the magazine <i>Outing</i>, a writer named Ritchie G. Betts mocked Edison for promising &#x201c;a featherweight and inexhaustible battery, or one which may, by the twist of a wrist or the pass of a hand, draw power, and be recharged from the skies or the atmosphere or whatnot, and lo! all problems are solved! The ideal automobile is at hand!&#x201d; But the critical voices would be overwhelmed by a press infatuated with the myth of Edison, the Wizard.By 1903, Edison&#x2019;s workers were dropping his nickel-iron batteries into cars and logging miles, and conducting primitive abuse testing by throwing batteries out of third-story windows of their Orange, New Jersey, lab. By the following year, they had pushed the battery to impressive new levels of capacity: 14 watt-hours per pound, 233 percent better than the lead-acid batteries of the day. It wasn&#x2019;t quite triple, but it was close enough.Edison launched his Type E nickel-iron battery with a level of hype and overpromising that would do today&#x2019;s most egregious vaporware vendors proud. It was a &#x201c;revolutionary&#x201d; new battery that would &#x201c;last longer than four or five automobiles.&#x201d; Predictably, Edison&#x2019;s fans in the press were enthralled. The nickel-iron battery &#x201c;revolutionized the world of power.&#x201d; The &#x201c;age of stored electric...</p><h2>Exploring English, Level 2</h2><p><p>This fully illustrated six-level series will set your students on the road to English language fluency. <i>Exploring English</i>, written by Tim Harris and illustrated by Allan Rowe, teaches all four language skills right from the start, and gives students a wealth of opportunities to practice what they've learned.

Opening on Thanksgiving Day in the late 1990s--three years after the former fashion-model president was laughed out of office for admitting that Saint Nicholas knew more about the workings of the executive branch than he did--the White House is implicated in a plot to rid America of its surplus people and the Third World of its nuclear weapons.</p></p><p>Ishmael Reed is the author of over twenty-five books including Mumbo Jumbo, The Last Days of Louisiana Red, Yellow Back Radio Broke-Down and Juice!. He is also a publisher, television producer, songwriter, radio and television commentator, lecturer, and has long been devoted to exploring an alternative black aesthetic: the trickster tradition, or Neo-Hoodooism as he calls it. Founder of the Before Columbus Foundation, he taught at the University of California, Berkeley for over thirty years, retiring in 2005. In 2003, he received the coveted Otto Award for political theater.Reed's jazzlike, surreal phantasmagoria is set in the late 1990s, in an America where millions of surps (homeless people) forage for food, while U.S. President Jesse Hatch is a figurehead manipulated by televangelist Rev. Clement Jones, his spiritual adviser. The former president, ex-fashion model Dean Clift (star of The Terrible Twos , this novel's predecessor) has been removed from office but will soon stage a comeback. Among the convoluted subplots, two drive the action: White House communications chief Robert Krantz's "lone cowboy" scheme to drop neutron bombs on New York and Miami, then place the blame on Nigeria; and billionaire toymaker Elder Marse's plan to exploit the charisma of dwarfish Rastafarian Black Peter. Reed's uproarious, wisecracking, deadly serious farce swings between the inspired and the heavy-handed, but when he is on target, which is much of the time, he is one of the sharpest socio-political satirists around, hurling pointed barbs at racism, the CIA, women, the Vatican, the New York literary crowd and Americans' demand for instant gratification. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Insider&#39;s Guide to the Colleges, 2015: Students on Campus Tell You What You Really Want to Know, 41st Edition (Insider&#39;s Guide to the Colleges: Students on Campus)</h2><p><p>With this new edition, The Insider's Guide to the Colleges has been, for 41 years, the most relied-upon resource for high school students looking for honest reports on colleges straight from the college students themselves.

There had been no rumor of their coming. Brock Rault, the Seuir ande Lette, thought they were bandits when the first handful appeared. Then his conscience threw up the fear that they might represent Tormond of Khaurene. The Duke of the End of Connec had forbidden the construction of new fortifications except under ducal charter. Unfinished, Lette was just the sort of fastness that Tormond had proscribed.<br><br>Fortifications were appearing throughout the End of Connec. And caused more despair than comfort. The universal inclination seemed to be, once a man was confident of his own defenses, to hire mercenaries and become a plague upon his neighbors.<br><br>The Seuir ande Lette was an exception. Barely twenty-one, nevertheless, he had been with Count Raymone Garete at the Black Mountain Massacre and was a veteran of the Calziran Crusade. He had smelled the cruel beast War's foul breath. He had tasted blood. He loathed his family's enemies but never so much that he felt compelled to gift them with terror, death, or pain.<br><br>Peace was the root of his faith, though he was a warrior born and consecrated.<br><br>Brock Rault was Maysalean, a Seeker After Light. Peaceable by belief and a heretic by declaration of the Brothen Episcopal Church. He did not hide his beliefs.<br><br>The enemy drew closer, too quickly for some peasants to get safely inside Caron ande Lette. The Seuir realized that the invaders were no brigands. But neither were they much more, except in numbers. A banner identified them as followers of the Grolsacher mercenary captain, Haiden Backe. Backe operated under letters of marque from Patriarch Sublime V. He roamed the northeastern marches of the Connec, supposedly punishing heretics. In actuality, he plundered anyone who would not buy an exemption.<br><br>For his troubles, Haiden Backe received a third of the plunder, which he had to share with his troops. The rest went to the Church.<br>The Church was desperate for funds. Sublime had to repay loans taken during the Calziran Crusade. Any default meant there would be no loans in future. Nor had he yet finished paying for votes he had bought during the Patriarchal election. And he wanted to raise new armies to launch another crusade against the Pramans occupying much of the Holy Lands.<br><br>Past crusades had established Brothen Episcopal footholds amongst the Wells of Ihrian, as Crusader principalities and kingdoms. During the last decade, though, those states had been under severe pressure from the Kaifate of Qasr al-Zed and its great champion, Indala al-Sul Halaladin. Sublime desperately wanted history to acclaim him the Patriarch who wrested the Holy Lands from the Unbeliever forever. His extermination of heresy at home would finance the glorious mission overseas.<br><br>Honario Benedocto, who had schemed and bribed his way into the Patriarchy, was loathed with enthusiasm by millions.<br><br>The Seuir ande Lette turned to his nearest companion, a gray man in his early sixties. "What say you, Perfect Master? It seems the hour of despair has arrived sooner than you forethought."<br><br>The Perfect Master of the Path, Brother Candle from Khaurene, bowed his head. "I'm tempted to declare my shame. As though my coming conjured this pestilence. As to advice, I can only repeat the admonition of the Synod of St. Jeules. Let no Seeker After Light be first to raise his hand against another man. But let no Seeker strengthen evil through any failure to resist it."<br><br>Brother Candle had argued against that stance. He was a pacifist at heart. But once the synod reached its decision he set out to prepare his Seeker brethren to defend themselves. Some would destroy them rather than recognize their special relationship with the Divine.<br><br>The young knight told Brother Candle, "He'll talk first. His men won't want a real fight or a long siege. Get away from Lette while you can."<br><br>Brother Candle stared out at the raiders. Few of them were driven by their devotion to the Episcopal faith. They were mercenaries because they could do nothing else. Without this marginally religious pretense they would be simple brigands.<br><br>More than one darkness stalks the earth.<br><br>"No stain of cowardice would attach to you, Master," Brock Rault promised. "We'd all rather that one so rare as you be removed from harm's way. Haiden Backe will offer you no respect." Rault's brothers and cousins nodded as they prepared to fight. "And you can carry our plea for help to Count Raymone."<br><br>Brother Candle went to stand alone, to meditate. To seek the best path. To discover how he could best serve. To let the Light move him.<br><br>The flesh was loath to go. The flesh dreaded what secret thoughts others might entertain if he chose flight. Yet he would do no one any good, ever, if he let himself be butchered at Caron ande Lette. The Church would crow because one of the Adversary's most favored had fallen-while insisting that it had nothing to do with Haiden Backe's campaign. Slipping the Grolsacher a bonus for having disposed of one of those pesky Maysalean Perfects.<br><br>Rault said, "I'll have a fast horse brought to the water postern."<br><br>"I arrived on foot," the holy man replied. "So shall I depart."<br><br>No one argued. A man afoot, in tattered clothing, would be ignored. The outlanders did not understand Maysalean vows of poverty.<br><br>Brock Rault engaged the Grolsacher warlord in pointless discourse. He hinted that, offered the right terms, Caron ande Lette might yield without an exchange of blows. Haiden Backe would not find negotiations unusual. Connectens seldom chose to fight in the face of superior numbers. Then Brock's youngest brother, Thurm, reported, "The Perfect Master is out of sight."<br><br>Rault grunted, gave the signal. The result would stain his soul indelibly. But he knew that soul would return for another turn around the wheel. He did not hesitate to greet evil with unexpected evil. He had learned that from Count Raymone Garete.<br><br>Archers sprang up and let fly. Backe's standard bearer and herald fell from their horses, as did two priests in dun cassocks. A third priest, of substance because he wore armor, survived the hail but had to extricate himself from his wounded mount.<br><br>Haiden Backe flung a hand into the path of an arrow streaking toward his face. Which exposed the gap in armor under his arm. An arrow found it, broke as its head hit a rib, and turned. It failed to reach his heart.<br><br>A companion snatched the reins of Backe's horse. The remaining raiders galloped away, pursued by missiles. A ballista shaft slammed through one, deep into the neck of his mount.<br><br>Only the armored priest escaped unscathed.<br><br>Brock's sister Socia, just sixteen, observed, "Sublime will use this against us."<br><br>"Of course he will. But these men, who don't work for the Patriarch, were here already, without just cause. They mean to steal our lives, our fortunes, and our good names. What else can their not-employer take away?"<br><br>Thurm sneered, "He could always excommunicate us."<br><br>Everyone in earshot laughed.<br><br>Brock said, "None of those people appear to have perished. Let's help them get to this heaven they're determined to force upon us."<br><br>Even the fallen priests were disinclined to meet their God today. One volunteered to renounce Sublime V in favor of the Anti-Patriarch, Immaculate II.<br><br>Brock let that one inscribe a letter confessing the Brothen Church's Grolsacher connections. He had the rest bound to stakes and left to the mercy of their deity. Within easy bowshot. Should their fellows be overwhelmed by an impulse to rescue them.<br><br>The mercenary force surrounded Caron ande Lette.<br><br>"Wow!" Socia said. Fearfully. "There's a lot of them."<br><br>"But in disarray," Brock replied. "They don't know what to do now. And Haiden Backe can't tell them."<br><br>That situation persisted for three days. Backe's underlings launched several clumsy attacks. Each failed.<br><br>Haiden Backe lost his struggle with fever and sepsis. The Bishop of Strang, the Grolsacher priest who could afford armor, declared himself Backe's successor. The mercenaries quickly expressed their confidence in the Bishop and the aims of the Brothen Patriarch. That night more than thirty resigned under cover of darkness.<br><br>Morcant Farfog, Bishop of Strang, was one of countless corrupt, incompetent bishops associated with the Brothen Patriarchy. Sublime had found that he could ease his fiscal woes by selling new bishoprics.<br><br>A rudimentary bureaucracy meant to raise funds through sales of livings, pardons, bequests, and indulgences was in its formative stage.<br><br>Sublime needed the money.<br><br>The Anti-Patriarch, Immaculate, at Viscesment, moaned and carried on but never really seized the moral opportunity. He was close to abandoning the struggle against the Usurpers of the Mother City.<br><br>The mercenaries besieging Caron ande Lette had little to recommend them. But most were not stupid. Few failed to see through Bishop Farfog's bluster. He was supremely incompetent, completely self-involved, and certain to cause fatalities amongst those dim enough to remain in his vicinity.<br><br>Desertions continued apace.<br><br>Two hours of brisk hiking took Brother Candle to Artlan ande Brith. Seuir Lanne Tuldse was a skeletal, elderly Maysalean knight. Seuir Lanne had kept faith with Khaurene. He had observed the letter of Duke Tormond's proclamation against erecting fortifications.<br><br>"Come," Seuir Lanne told the Perfect Master. "We'll go up to the house. From there you'll be able to see the smoke if they fire Caron ande Lette."<br><br>"The house" was a stone manor balanced precariously atop a tall, bristling outcrop of weathered limestone. Not, strictly, a fortress. But difficult to enter if the inhabitants preferred that you stay out.<br><br>Fifteen minutes after the Perfect Master's arrival Lanne Tuldse's grandson galloped south toward Antieux. He would raise alarums along the way.<br><br>The boy ran into one of Count Raymone's patrols. They led him to an encampment on the Old Brothen military highway, the Inland Road, which followed the western bank of the Dechear River. Here the river marked the traditional boundary between the End of Connec and Ormienden, a hodgepodge of counties and minuscule principalities of mixed and varied allegiance, some to the Grail Empire, some to the Patriarchy, some to kingdoms in nearby Firaldia. A few, by marriage, even owed fealty to the ruling houses of Arnhand and Santerin. The harsh vistas of Grolsach lay only eight leagues away, beyond a tongue of Ormienden occupied by entities called Imp and Manu. Count Raymone meant to confront would-be invaders who chose to use the Inland Road. That being the route selected by previous invaders from Arnhand. He felt compelled to resist vigorously. Occupation of the Connec's eastern marches would isolate the rest of the province from the assistance of the Empire.<br><br>The Count's spies in Grolsach had learned the truth about Sublime's secret letters of marque. Raymone meant to smash anyone who took them up before they reached the cities of the eastern Connec.<br><br>Antieux was a magnet for invaders. Antieux had delivered embarrassments to several forces trying to perpetrate the Patriarch's villainies.<br><br>Count Raymone did not have the blessing of Duke Tormond. The Duke clung tenaciously to the illusion that Sublime would keep promises he had made in exchange for Connecten support in his crusade against Calzir. Tormond could not understand that Sublime did not feel obligated to keep faith with heretics. Lying was no sin when you lied to Unbelievers.<br><br>Count Raymone moved as soon as he received word. He reached Artlan ande Brith two days later. While the Count's soldiers made camp Brother Candle responded to a summons from the hotheaded, headstrong lord of Antieux.<br><br>Count Raymone greeted him warmly. "Desperate hours bring us together again, eh, Master?"<br><br>"Existence consists of cycles and convergences," Brother Candle replied. "Even in the upwelling of wickedness. Not to mention demands upon our respective professions."<br><br>"Tell me about these Grolsachers."<br><br>"I can't."<br><br>"Won't?" Count Raymone was accustomed to the vagaries of the Maysalean conscience. Some were determined to remain pacifist, whatever befell them.<br><br>"Cannot. The young seuir hustled me out the back door as soon as he recognized the threat."<br><br>"Brock Rault is the perfect knight. He fought well against the Arnhanders. He'd have done well in Shippen if the damned Calzirans had bothered to fight back."<br><br>"Just as well they didn't. The inevitable would have devoured them."<br><br>"Good for us, too." Because Connectens had served in the Calziran Crusade they had established certain rights. Though they had won no honors from the Patriarch, they had helped deliver vast new territories into the realm of Peter, King of Navaya. King Peter, whose queen was Duke Tormond's sister, was now a protector of the Connec.<br><br>"Yes. So?"<br><br>"Are you going to preach to me, Master?" Count Raymone was intimidating. He was tall, lean, dark, and seemed older than his twenty-four and a half years. He had a long scar over his left eye that made him look more ferocious than he was. Swollen and discolored, it was still healing.<br><br>Brother Candle raised a brushy gray eyebrow. "I'd rather you call me Brother."<br><br>"I have Maysalean evangelists in my family, Brother. I recognize the light in your eye that means a bout of holy instruction is due to begin." The Count was known for his sardonic sense of humor.<br><br>Brother Candle's other eyebrow jumped up. Then he chuckled.<br><br>"That won't work, either, Brother. I feel no need to be your pal. You people are transparent manipulators."<br><br>"Then I bow to youth's need to make its own mistakes."<br><br>"Transparent."<br><br>Brother Candle gave up. Count Raymone would give him no foothold. It was too late, anyway. Hell's tendrils had been creeping into the End of Connec for years. Ill-tempered time had begotten evil pups. He was wasting it trying to stem the cruel tide. His obligation now was to preserve and cherish what little he could.<br><br>He snorted. A Seeker After Light, a Perfect, did not entertain such conceits as Hell. Hell existed only in the Episcopal mind. The more primitive Chaldarean cults, on the far reaches of the world, believed in an Adversary but not in a Pit of Eternal Torment. Brother Candle did not know how the Hell concept had crept into the western form of Chaldareanism. In other strains, as was the case in the ancestral Devedian and Dainshau religions, all punishment and reward happened right here, right now, in this world.<br><br>The Deves and Dainshaus should have had the wickedness hammered out of them by now. Their God and the Chaldareans had been punishing them forever.<br><br>"You are amused, Master?"<br><br>"Brother. My thoughts veered to the plight of those who reject the Path. These days they must believe their gods particularly spiteful and callous."<br><br>"And no less do they deserve, bending their knees to the Tyranny of the Night."<br><br>And there lay the paradox of the world.<br><br>God was real, if long unseen. All gods were real. Sometimes they reached into the mortal world. Every demon, devil, and sprite ever imagined was real, somewhere. Spirits of tree and river and stone were real. Things that lay in wait in the dark were painfully real and still found even in lands where the ruling faith officially denied them. Even in the End of Connec, which had been acclaimed as tame since the days of the Old Empire, night things were hidden away. The little ones remained where...</p><h2>The Conscience of the Constitution: The Declaration of Independence and the Right to Liberty</h2><p>Is liberty or democracy the primary constitutional value? At a time when Americans are increasingly facing violations of their civil liberties, Timothy Sandefur&#39;s insightful new book explains why the Declaration of Independence, with its doctrines on the primacy of liberty, the natural rights of man, and the limits on legitimate government, should serve as the guidepost for understanding the Constitution. The author takes the reader through the ideas of substantive due process and judicial activism and defends them from mainstream criticisms while drawing on examples from literature, television, and Supreme Court cases. The Conscience of the Constitution: The Declaration of Independence and the Right to Liberty argues that modern legal doctrines, which value democracy over liberty, are endangering individual rights and corrupting our civic institutions.</p><p><i> The Conscience of the Constitution: The Declaration of Independence and the Right to Liberty</i> documents a vital, forgotten truth: our Constitution was written not to empower democracy, but to secure liberty. In fact, the word "democracy" does not occur in either the Constitution or the Declaration of Independence. Yet, to author and constitutional scholar Timothy Sandefur, the overemphasis on democracy by today's legal community--rather than the primacy of liberty, as expressed in the Declaration of Independence--has helped expand the scope of government power at the expense of individual rights.<br><br>Now, more than ever, the Declaration of Independence should be the framework for interpreting our fundamental law. It is the conscience of the Constitution. "Liberty comes first and order arises from it," states Sandefur. "We have gone astray in our constitutional understanding because we have upended that relationship."<br><br><i>The Conscience of the Constitution</i> traces this upheaval back to the timeless conflict between freedom and power that gave rise to the Civil War and that was revived again by the Supreme Court's disastrous ruling in the 1873 <i>Slaughter-House</i> cases. Sandefur then examines the origins of controversial legal theories such as "substantive due process" and "judicial activism" and defends them against a wave of arguments from both left and the right. Although both sides of the political spectrum criticize the courts today for protecting individual rights too effectively, Sandefur shows that in reality judges have often abdicated their duty to rein in government abuses.<br><br>Today, more and more Americans are witnessing their individual freedoms threatened and destroyed by the continually expanding grasp of government. While Americans will always differ over important political issues, our Constitution was meant to ensure that some things should not be settled by majority vote. In <i>The Conscience of the Constitution,</i> Timothy Sandefur presents a dramatic, richly compelling new challenge to the status quo of constitutional law.<b>Timothy Sandefur</b> is an adjunct scholar at the Cato Institute, an attorney at the Pacific Legal Foundation, and the author of <i>The Right To Earn a Living: Economic Freedom and the Law</i> and <i>Cornerstone of Liberty: Property Rights in 21st Century America</i>.

All Gods, Elder and Younger, share the people and the land of Dhrall equally. But the one place they never enter is The Wasteland: a barren and hideous wilderness ruled by the Vlagh--a god-like creature whose young are evil spawn. Now, as the Elder Gods are about to transfer their power to the Younger Gods, the Vlagh plans to take advantage of their weakened state and neutralize them, eventually conquering the world. To do so, it is breeding a terrible force borne of monsters and demons. But one ray of hope shines through the darkness: four children called the Dreamers. They alone hold the power to change the course of history...and stop the Vlagh in its quest for total world domination.<br></p><p>David and Leigh Eddings introduce readers to their newly minted Land of Dhrall with <i>The Elder Gods</i>, the first book in the four-book Dreamers Saga. Dhrall is under the gentle rule of four gods representing the four compass points. These gods are reaching the end of their terms of power when the god of the North brings four children who are destined to take over for them into his siblings' lairs. The children are dreamers and able to see the possible outcome of battles in a coming war with the evil creature that controls the wasteland at the center of Drahll's map. Thus, the gods and their young charges undertake quests to hire mercenary armies and thwart the initial invasion into their lands. <p> The book unfolds like a children's primer. This pedantic style proves to be heavy-handed for adult readers and will quickly try their patience. If the Eddings were trying to concoct a book that would be suitable for reading aloud to fifth graders they've succeeded, but even the most die-hard fantasy fan will tire quickly of the sing-song approach and plot twists that can be sniffed out from miles away. <i>--Jeremy Pugh</i></p>David and Leigh Eddings live in Carson City, Nevada.</p><h2>U.S. Special Operations Forces: Special Operations Warrior Foundation (2012) (Beaux Arts Editions)</h2><p>Written by an outstanding team of distinguished active and retired special operations officers, historians, and experts, this in-depth book surveys America&#39;s elite forces.

The French Line's dazzling ocean liner <em>S.S. France</em> was alone in her class until the arrival of the QE2 in 1967. She was fast, chic, lavishly manned, and offered sumptuous catering. For a dozen years she was a star on the North Atlantic. However, in the summer of 1974, with jet airliners dominating transatlantic travel, <em>France</em> was withdrawn and allowed to molder for five years.<br><br> Then a miraculous reprieve: the head of Norwegian Cruise Line decided to buy <em>France</em>; the vessel was revamped for warm weather and rechristened <em>Norway</em>. One of the last North Atlantic liners became the Caribbean's first megaship. The singularity of this incredible hull that sailed in two contrasting modes demands remembrance&#x2015;she was <em>the</em> pioneering big ship, popularizing a scale of cruising then unknown. 270 black-and-white and color photographs and illustrations</p><p>John Maxtone-Graham (1929&#x2013;2015) wrote many books on trans-Atlantic ocean travel, among them Titanic Tragedy: A New Look at the Lost Liner, Normandie: France's Legendary Art Deco Ocean Liner, and The Only Way to Cross, which has been in print for almost forty years.*Starred Review* Like mammals, which wrested the world from the dinosaurs, the jet plane quickly became the most popular and economical way to cross the Atlantic during the 1960s, leading to a decline in bookings on ocean liners. Into this transitional world, the French Line nevertheless launched the magnificent France in 1960; at the time, it was the longest passenger ship in the world and certainly one of the most elegant of the classic Atlantic-crossing queens. But the economic times in which the France lived took their toll on the ships livelihood, and a dozen years after it entered service, the great ship was withdrawn, never to grace the waves between Europe and New York again. Fortunately, it was not yet confined to the scrap heap. A few years after retirement, the France was converted into the cruise ship Norway to live a few years more, although not in the same royal state. Maxtone-Graham, an expert on passenger-ship history and author of the seminal The Only Way to Cross (1972), here documents, with considerable authority and passion, the story of the France/Norway from inception and design to eventual scrapping at an Indian port. The illustrations in this lovely oversize book are plentiful and gorgeous, all contributing to a vibrant, informative book that all ship lovers, travelers, and students of social history will greatly appreciate. --Brad Hooper</p><h2>Jimmy Swaggart Bible Commentary Proverbs (JImmy Swaggart Bible Commentary)</h2><p>The Book of Proverbs is the Wisdom of God.

Neither strictly chronological, or exclusively a history, <i>Into the Maelstrom </i>investigates a wide range of improvisational tendencies: from surrealist automatism to stream-of-consciousness in literature and vocalization; from the free music of Percy Grainger to the free improvising groups emerging out of the early 1960s (Group Ongaku, Nuova Consonanza, MEV, AMM, the Spontaneous Music Ensemble); and from free jazz to the strands of free improvisation that sought to distance itself from jazz. In exploring the diverse ways in which spontaneity became a core value in the early twentieth century as well as free improvisation's connection to both 1960s rock (The Beatles, Cream, Pink Floyd) and the era of post-Cagean indeterminacy in composition, Toop provides a definitive and all-encompassing exploration of free improvisation up to 1970, ending with the late 1960s international developments of free music from Roscoe Mitchell in Chicago, Peter Br�tzmann in Berlin and Han Bennink and Misha Mengelberg in Amsterdam.</p><p>The first volume in a two volume text covering music and improvisation from the beginnings to 1970.<b>David Toop </b>is a writer, musician and curator.

After centuries of repression and censorship, the sexual component in thousands of revered icons of Christ is restored to visibility. Steinberg's evidence resides in the imagery of the overtly sexed Christ, in Infancy and again after death. Steinberg argues that the artists regarded the deliberate exposure of Christ's genitalia as an affirmation of kinship with the human condition. Christ's lifelong virginity, understood as potency under check, and the first offer of blood in the circumcision, both required acknowledgment of the genital organ. More than exercises in realism, these unabashed images underscore the crucial theological import of the Incarnation.&nbsp;<br><br>This revised and greatly expanded edition not only adduces new visual evidence, but deepens the theological argument and engages the controversy aroused by the book's first publication.<br><br></p><p></p><h2>Beck Beyond the Sea (Disney Fairies)</h2><p>Beck can&#39;t help wondering what lies outside Pixie Hollow.

In this lucid, authoritative biography, Duffy, a senior lecturer at the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst, England, traces Frederick's rise from romantic Prussian prince and officer to leader of armies whose battlefield brilliance marked the transition from medieval to modern warfare. A contradictory figure ("a cynical exponent of power-politics, a prince of the Enlightenment, and a lover of the arts"), Frederick achieved renown throughout Europe during the brutal Silesian Wars and Seven Years War, in which he relied on artillery, battle-ready infantries, and the strategies of diversion to win victories. A well-researched life of a military genius. Photos. January 16<br>Copyright 1985 Reed Business Information, Inc.This useful treatise by a respected English military historian is a particularly satisfying reiteration of the military career of Prussia's great soldier-king. Duffy examines Frederick's strategic problems and tactical innovations in minute detail, fully capturing his fascinating blend of romanticism and cold-eyed military pragmatism. The technical discussions are lucid and aided by a praiseworthy selection of maps. This makes a brilliant supplement to the standard biographies, but because little attention is given to the other phases of Frederick's personal and professional life, it does not replace them.

Here the three are pitted against Evaristus Sloane, an insane wizard and inventor. But even more frightening than Sloane is a robot he invented some 50 years before. The robot was built to look like a baseball player and to pitch balls, but the Professor, Johnny, and Fergie discover a much darker side to the mechanism.

Rex and Rose Mary Walls had four children. In the beginning, they lived like nomads, moving among Southwest desert towns, camping in the mountains. Rex was a charismatic, brilliant man who, when sober, captured his children's imagination, teaching them physics, geology, and above all, how to embrace life fearlessly. Rose Mary, who painted and wrote and couldn't stand the responsibility of providing for her family, called herself an "excitement addict." Cooking a meal that would be consumed in fifteen minutes had no appeal when she could make a painting that might last forever. <p> Later, when the money ran out, or the romance of the wandering life faded, the Walls retreated to the dismal West Virginia mining town -- and the family -- Rex Walls had done everything he could to escape.

She had tied rags around her shoulders to keep out the spring chill and was picking through the trash while her dog, a black-and-white terrier mix, played at her feet. Mom's gestures were all familiar -- the way she tilted her head and thrust out her lower lip when studying items of potential value that she'd hoisted out of the Dumpster, the way her eyes widened with childish glee when she found something she liked. Her long hair was streaked with gray, tangled and matted, and her eyes had sunk deep into their sockets, but still she reminded me of the mom she'd been when I was a kid, swan-diving off cliffs and painting in the desert and reading Shakespeare aloud. Her cheekbones were still high and strong, but the skin was parched and ruddy from all those winters and summers exposed to the elements. To the people walking by, she probably looked like any of the thousands of homeless people in New York City.<br><br>It had been months since I laid eyes on Mom, and when she looked up, I was overcome with panic that she'd see me and call out my name, and that someone on the way to the same party would spot us together and Mom would introduce herself and my secret would be out.<br><br>I slid down in the seat and asked the driver to turn around and take me home to Park Avenue.<br><br>The taxi pulled up in front of my building, the doorman held the door for me, and the elevator man took me up to my floor. My husband was working late, as he did most nights, and the apartment was silent except for the click of my heels on the polished wood floor. I was still rattled from seeing Mom, the unexpectedness of coming across her, the sight of her rooting happily through the Dumpster. I put some Vivaldi on, hoping the music would settle me down.<br><br>I looked around the room. There were the turn-of-the-century bronze-and-silver vases and the old books with worn leather spines that I'd collected at flea markets. There were the Georgian maps I'd had framed, the Persian rugs, and the overstuffed leather armchair I liked to sink into at the end of the day. I'd tried to make a home for myself here, tried to turn the apartment into the sort of place where the person I wanted to be would live. But I could never enjoy the room without worrying about Mom and Dad huddled on a sidewalk grate somewhere. I fretted about them, but I was embarrassed by them, too, and ashamed of myself for wearing pearls and living on Park Avenue while my parents were busy keeping warm and finding something to eat.<br><br>What could I do? I'd tried to help them countless times, but Dad would insist they didn't need anything, and Mom would ask for something silly, like a perfume atomizer or a membership in a health club. They said that they were living the way they wanted to.<br><br>After ducking down in the taxi so Mom wouldn't see me, I hated myself -- hated my antiques, my clothes, and my apartment. I had to do something, so I called a friend of Mom's and left a message. It was our system of staying in touch. It always took Mom a few days to get back to me, but when I heard from her, she sounded, as always, cheerful and casual, as though we'd had lunch the day before. I told her I wanted to see her and suggested she drop by the apartment, but she wanted to go to a restaurant. She loved eating out, so we agreed to meet for lunch at her favorite Chinese restaurant.<br><br>Mom was sitting at a booth, studying the menu, when I arrived. She'd made an effort to fix herself up. She wore a bulky gray sweater with only a few light stains, and black leather men's shoes. She'd washed her face, but her neck and temples were still dark with grime.<br><br>She waved enthusiastically when she saw me. "It's my baby girl!" she called out. I kissed her cheek. Mom had dumped all the plastic packets of soy sauce and duck sauce and hot-and-spicy mustard from the table into her purse. Now she emptied a wooden bowl of dried noodles into it as well. "A little snack for later on," she explained.<br><br>We ordered. Mom chose the Seafood Delight. "You know how I love my seafood," she said.<br><br>She started talking about Picasso. She'd seen a retrospective of his work and decided he was hugely overrated. All the cubist stuff was gimmicky, as far as she was concerned. He hadn't really done anything worthwhile after his Rose Period.<br><br>"I'm worried about you," I said. "Tell me what I can do to help."<br><br>Her smile faded. "What makes you think I need your help?"<br><br>"I'm not rich," I said. "But I have some money. Tell me what it is you need."<br><br>She thought for a moment. "I could use an electrolysis treatment."<br><br>"Be serious."<br><br>"I am serious. If a woman looks good, she feels good."<br><br>"Come on, Mom." I felt my shoulders tightening up, the way they invariably did during these conversations. "I'm talking about something that could help you change your life, make it better."<br><br>"You want to help me change my life?" Mom asked. "I'm fine. You're the one who needs help. Your values are all confused."<br><br>"Mom, I saw you picking through trash in the East Village a few days ago."<br><br>"Well, people in this country are too wasteful. It's my way of recycling." She took a bite of her Seafood Delight. "Why didn't you say hello?"<br><br>"I was too ashamed, Mom. I hid."<br><br>Mom pointed her chopsticks at me. "You see?" she said. "Right there. That's exactly what I'm saying. You're way too easily embarrassed. Your father and I are who we are. Accept it."<br><br>"And what am I supposed to tell people about my parents?"<br><br>"Just tell the truth," Mom said. "That's simple enough."<br><br>Copyright � 2005 by Jeannette Walls</p><h2>War of the Century: When Hitler Fought Stalin</h2><p>This text offers interviews with witnesses who knew Stalin and Hitler, together with documents from Russian archives. It explores in detail the reasons why Hitler invaded Russia, why it was a mistake to believe Hitler was a reasonable conqueror, and, ultimately, was Stalin another Hitler?</p><p>Labeling the Second World War battles between Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia on the Eastern Front as the <i>War of the Century</i> is asking for trouble. What about the First World War, not to mention the other theaters of the 1939-45 conflict? Laurence Rees argues that the brutality of the fighting was unprecedented and that the outcome, with the annihilation of the German troops, was pivotal to the Allies' eventual victory. On both counts, he is absolutely right. The severe cold, hunger, shelling, and hand-to-hand street-fighting decimated both sides, and the casualties ran into the millions. And, yes, Germany never did recover neither physically nor mentally. The supposedly unbeatable one had been beaten. But does this make it a war of the century? To decontextualize the Eastern Front is to miss the bigger picture. This was not just a war between two competing ideologies--Communism and Nazism. The Russians, whatever their politics, were Britain's and America's allies; they may have had a separate private agenda in the war--what country didn't?--but they were on the right side and part of an overall allied effort. Moreover, Rees's position lets the Germans off the hook somewhat. It allows them to make the revisionist claim that they were fighting Communism--something that became a holy cause in the West in the postwar years. They weren't. They were Nazis fighting the Allies. End of story. Rees also goes on to make the somewhat bizarre claim that the German defeat unleashed the Holocaust against the Jews. This will come as a massive surprise to the millions of Jews who were persecuted in the 10 years prior to 1943. It is true that the death camps went into overdrive after the defeat in Russia, but this would almost certainly also have happened if the Germans had won. The result on the Eastern Front was immaterial. However, there is also much to recommend in <i>War of the Century</i>. The comparisons between Hitler's Nazi Germany and Stalin's state capitalist U.S.S.R. are well made. Repression and contempt for life existed on both sides. Rees has found much new material from the newly opened Soviet archives and has also turned up many eyewitnesses from both sides, and their accounts provide a compellingly readable narrative. For this alone, the book is worth reading. At times it feels as if Rees is being willfully controversial simply to be noticed. But he needn't have bothered, because there was a fascinating book there anyway. <i>--John Crace, Amazon.co.uk</i><b>Laurence Rees</b> is the editor of <i>Timewatch</i>, BBC Television's historical documentary series, which has won three Emmy Awards in three years.

But how do we process what we hear every day? And how does it affect our brains and our minds? &nbsp;This book answers such revealing questions as:<br><ul><li>How do bats see in 3D with their ears and how did that lead to the development of medical ultrasound?</li><li>What is it about the sound of fingernails on a chalkboard that makes us cringe?</li><li>Why do city folks have trouble sleeping in the country, and vice versa?</li><li>Why can't you get that song out of your head?</li></ul><br> Starting with the basics of auditory biology, neuroscientist and musician Seth Horowitz explains how sound affects us, and in turn, how we've learned to manipulate sound: into music, commercial jingles, car horns, and modern inventions like cochlear implants, ultrasound scans, and the mosquito ringtone. Whether you're standing in a crowded subway or a quiet meadow, you'll never hear the same way after reading this book. <i>The Universal Sense</i> gives new insight into what the sounds of our world have to do with the way we think, feel, and interact.</p><p><b>Seth S. Horowitz, Ph.D.</b> is a neuroscientist and professor at Brown University. He is the co-founder of NeuroPop, the first sound design and consulting firm to use neurosensory and psychophysical algorithms in music, sound design, and sonic branding. He is married to sound and biomimetic artist China Blue and lives in Warwick, RI.We live in a sonic world. Sounds and vibration affect our mood, memories, and mind. Neuroscientist Horowitz&#x2019;s aim is to amp up understanding and respect for our auditory environment. He draws on physiology, physics, and psychology to demonstrate &#x201c;how sound and hearing have shaped the evolution, development, and day-to-day function of the mind.&#x201d; Sound assists in mating, playing, and acquiring food. Hearing helps us stay vigilant and monitor our surroundings. Horowitz contemplates the difficulty in defining music and how it influences the mind. He highlights the power of acoustics by invoking our usual reaction to the noise of fingernails scraping across a blackboard, the employment of echolocation by bats, and the love songs of frogs. He defuses the hype of sound-based weaponry that dates back to Joshua and his hundreds of warriors who blew on rams&#x2019; horns and shouted in unison to collapse the walls of Jericho. It must be myth or miracle, since physics alone cannot explain the magnitude of such a sonic blast. The science of sound is fascinating, and Horowitz is an author worth listening to. --Tony Miksanek</p><h2>XOM-B</h2><p><p>Freeman is a genius with an uncommon mixture of memory, intelligence and creativity. He lives in a worldwide utopia, but it was not always so. There was a time known as the Grind&#x2015;when Freeman's people lived as slaves to another race referred to simply as "Master." They were property. But a civil rights movement emerged. Change seemed near, but the Masters refused to bend. Instead, they declared war. </p><p>And lost. </p><p>Now, the freed world is threatened by a virus, spread through bites, sweeping through the population. Those infected are propelled to violence, driven to disperse the virus. Uniquely suited to respond to this new threat, Freeman searches for a cure, but instead finds the source&#x2015;the Masters, intent on reclaiming the world. Freeman must fight for his life, for his friends and for the truth, which is far more complex and dangerous than he ever imagined. </p><p>Robinson's lightning fast, cutting-edge novels have won over thriller, horror, science-fiction and action/adventure fans alike, and he has received high praise from peers like James Rollins, Jonathan Maberry, and Scott Sigler.

I sit up quickly. &#x201c;The raccoons are mating again.&#x201d; I smile, feeling excited at the prospect of finding the stripe-faced creatures. So much about them is foreign to me&#x2014;the way they walk, how they hunt, and survive, and live. Having so little experience with the world, there isn&#x2019;t much that doesn&#x2019;t thrill me, including raccoons and their nocturnal habits. <br>I&#x2019;m not sure why I sat up. I couldn&#x2019;t possibly see the raccoons. Not because I have poor eyesight. I don&#x2019;t. It&#x2019;s just that they live on the forest floor and I&#x2019;m sitting at the center of a rooftop. The old abandoned building, built from red bricks and mortar, is dilapidated, but still sturdy enough. The construction strikes me as flimsy, but it seems to be resisting erosion and the encroaching tree roots. I&#x2019;m still learning, but I&#x2019;ve come to one conclusion I&#x2019;m sure of: the world is always changing, yet always fighting against that change. I suppose that is the nature of things. <br>My escort&#x2014;I don&#x2019;t know his real name, so I call him Heap, on account of his size&#x2014;is far less interested in the world around us. Instead, he&#x2019;s wholly, at all times, focused on his mission: to protect me. From what, I&#x2019;m not sure. The world has never been safer. I suppose I could trip and fall from our ten-story-high perch, but that&#x2019;s just as unlikely as Heap going off mission. And it doesn&#x2019;t explain the weapon he carries. <br>I don&#x2019;t know what it is or what it does, but when he detects a strange shift in the wind or an out-of-place sound, he snaps that weapon up and scans the area before telling me to proceed. <br>Perhaps the strangest thing about Heap is that I&#x2019;ve never seen him without his armor, which is a deep blue exoskeleton. Like a bug. With round glowing white eyes, two on either side of his face. His mouth and chin are exposed, which allows him to speak clearly, and his four round eyes change shape with his moods, so he has no trouble emoting. But it&#x2019;s strange to never really see him. I know there is a man inside the suit, but he&#x2019;s a mystery&nbsp;&#x2026; and he&#x2019;s my closest friend. My only friend, I suppose. <br>He&#x2019;s knowledgeable about the world as it is, and as it was, during the Grind&#x2014;the time period when the Masters used people as slave labor&#x2014;but he&#x2019;s far from an expert on raccoons, or any of the mammals that populate the planet. But when he sits up next to me and says with uncommon reserve, &#x201c;That wasn&#x2019;t a raccoon,&#x201d; I believe him. <br>When he raises his weapon slowly and stands, I ask, &#x201c;What then?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Silence.&#x201d; He thrusts an open palm at me with practiced efficiency, punctuating the command. <br>Heap generally carries himself with a serious demeanor, but I&#x2019;ve never known him to be rude. Something has him heating up. <br>I stand without making a sound, maintaining perfect balance and stepping lightly despite the pitch black, moonless night. The tar covering, of what once was something called an apartment building, flexes slightly under my two hundred pound weight, but since it seems to hold Heap&#x2019;s girth just fine, I don&#x2019;t worry about it. <br>Heap&#x2019;s arm blocks my path as I near the edge. <br>&#x201c;I won&#x2019;t fall,&#x201d; I tell him. <br>He ignores me, scanning the evergreen forest that grows around and sometimes through the abandoned buildings. <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s impossible,&#x201d; I say, and I consider explaining all the safeguards that will keep me from losing my balance, but decide it would take far too long. The raccoons, or whatever they are, will be gone before I finish. Instead, I say, &#x201c;Even if I did fall, I could&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I cannot allow you to be hurt or by inaction allow harm to come to you,&#x201d; he says like he&#x2019;s practiced the line a thousand times. <br>&#x201c;You,&#x201d; I say, &#x201c;are not very fun.&#x201d; <br>He turns to me. &#x201c;Fun is not my job.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You are more than your job.&#x201d; <br>He thinks about this for a long moment, which for Heap is about half a second. &#x201c;It is not a raccoon.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Then what?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I cannot see it.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I might,&#x201d; I say and then tap my temple, next to my right eye. &#x201c;I have all the upgrades, remember? I can see better than the birds in the sky.&#x201d; <br>He remains frozen in place, solid, like one of the trees below. <br>&#x201c;You can hold onto me if you like,&#x201d; I say. <br>He looks back down at the trees. <br>&#x201c;If it&#x2019;s a danger to me, we need to find out what it is, right?&#x201d; <br>That does it. My looking over the edge of this building suddenly makes sense to the round-shouldered brute. I take his hand and his thick fingers clamp down tightly, compressing to the point where I think he might hurt me. He doesn&#x2019;t, though my shoulder joint would probably pop loose and my arm would separate long before he would lose his grip on my hand. <br>I step to the roof&#x2019;s edge, make a show of testing my weight on the foot-tall, brick wall, and step up. Standing on one foot, I lean out at a 45-degree angle, hovering over the forest, which now looks like it&#x2019;s reaching up to snatch me from the building&#x2019;s edge. <br>When Heap&#x2019;s grip tightens just a fraction more and I think my hand will be crushed, I stop leaning and look. The implants in my eyes are capable of viewing multiple spectrums, separately or all at once, though I prefer the clarity provided by focusing on groups of wavelengths at a time. They also have 200x optical zoom, meaning I can see things that are very far away like they&#x2019;re right next to me. Not that this helps me now. The swaying trees below block most of the visual spectrum, and the open spots are clouded by fine yellow pollen. <br>&#x201c;Are you sure it&#x2019;s not mating raccoons?&#x201d; I ask. &#x201c;Even the trees are mating.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Just look.&#x201d; <br>I blink and switch to infrared, revealing a good number of small animals. Birds sit in the trees and small mammals litter the forest floor. Before I switch to ultraviolet, I note something odd. Granted, I&#x2019;m new to nature, but over the past few weeks of observation, I have never seen the forest so absolutely still. I listen, tuning my sensitive ears to the sounds of the night. &#x201c;The insects are silent.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I know,&#x201d; Heap says. &#x201c;Audio upgrade.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Good for you,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;And here I thought you old guys couldn&#x2019;t change.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Just don&#x2019;t like to. Now look.&#x201d; <br>Blink. I switch to ultraviolet. Nothing. <br>Blink. I switch to electromagnetic. I see it right away. Well, not really. It&#x2019;s technically obscured from my direct line of sight, but I can see the electromagnetism cast from its form like the glow of a lightbulb. Each living thing on the planet has a unique electromagnetic signature, from fish to cows, but this one is distinct. It&#x2019;s a man. I&#x2019;m about to announce that I&#x2019;ve found something when I notice several more electromagnetic signatures closing in on the first. Three men. One woman. I&#x2019;m confused by this on several fronts, but manage to conclude, &#x201c;They&#x2019;re chasing him.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Are they human?&#x201d; he asks. <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; I say, confused. &#x201c;Of course they are.&#x201d; I look back in time to see Heap&#x2019;s grim expression. It&#x2019;s subtle&#x2014;I sometimes wonder if he&#x2019;s capable of emoting&#x2014;but I see the brief downturn of his mouth before he forces it away. &#x201c;What else could they be?&#x201d; <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>Copyright � 2014 by Jeremy Robinson <br></p><h2>Le Tartuffe: Ou L&#39;Imposteur (Petits Classiques Larousse) (French Edition)</h2><p>FOR USE IN SCHOOLS AND LIBRARIES ONLY.

To recover the human dimension of the founders, we need look no further than their own words. Through a series of revealing quotations, historian John P. Kaminski profiles thirty of the era&#x2019;s best-known individuals, including Benjamin Franklin, John Jay, Alexander Hamilton, John Hancock, Thomas Paine, and Patrick Henry ("all tongue without either head or heart," according to Thomas Jefferson), as well as the early presidents and their first ladies.</p><p>The discourse is unfailingly respectful, and yet this is no mutual admiration society. The subjects are not afraid to be sharp about one another, but this only makes their words of praise more convincing and poignant. One could hardly ask for a more clear-eyed, and touching, tribute than Thomas Jefferson&#x2019;s appraisal of George Washington: "He was incapable of fear, meeting personal dangers with the calmest unconcern....

McBride &amp; Julie Lindow: Left in the Dark: Portraits of San Francisco Movie Theatres</h2><p>In our age of Netflix and streaming videos, movie attendance continues its long decline, and cinema-going is becoming ever less of the collective experience Walter Benjamin so memorably described. Throughout the city of San Francisco, however, many theaters built between 1910 and 1950 are still standing, and some even remain in operation, serving as poignant reminders of Hollywood&#39;s Golden Age and the social interactions that once came with movie-going. R.A. McBride&#39;s lush color photographs--made with film cameras, of course--showcase these temples to celluloid in all their threadbare grandeur. Photographed empty, the buildings&#39; architectural qualities, from rotunda chandeliers and warmly glowing walls to drab lobbies and worn armrests, come to the fore. Essays by scholars and film exhibitors including Rebecca Solnit, Julie Lindow, Eddie Muller, Chi-Hui Yang and Gary Meyer cast light from personal and scholarly perspectives, examining the movie houses&#39; roles as characters in the cultural drama of the city.</p><p></p><h2>Living in Bali</h2><p><p>Loved by travelers for its lush, tropical scenery, and charming people, Bali is considered to be one of the most magnificent places on earth.

[He] writes beautiful phrases and sentences, and he has an instinctive feel for horror&#x2019;s flash points, those moments in a novel when its author must demonstrate that he can keep his head while his readers are cheerfully losing theirs.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;Peter Straub</p> <p>&#x201c;With <i>Westlake Soul</i>, Youers has established himself not only as one of the very best voices in speculative fiction, but as one of the best and most important voices in all fiction. . . . [It] is a masterpiece. It&#x2019;s the type of novel that will be read and re-read for years, a novel that writers will point to as the book that made them want to write or taught them how. It&#x2019;s that good. I could continue to pile on the praise, but I don&#x2019;t think that&#x2019;ll do this review or the book any justice. Just read it, and you&#x2019;ll understand.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<i>FearNet</i></p> <p>&#x201c;Rio Youers is one of the reasons why I&#x2019;m incredibly excited about, and optimistic for, the future of horror fiction. If you haven&#x2019;t read his work before then start right here! <i>Westlake Soul</i> is a novel about the very essence of what it is to be human. Numinous, poignant and achingly emotional, it is both deeply tragic and soaringly life-affirming.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;Mark Morris</p> <p>&#x201c;Rio Youers&#x2019;s storytelling is so charming, so affable, so apparently effortless, that you&#x2019;re still grinning like an idiot when the sheer horror of his imagination leaps up and suckerpunches you in the gut.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;Robert Shearman</p> <p>&#x201c;Rio Youers is as close to a unique voice as you&#x2019;re likely to find in today&#x2019;s world of emerging new talent. The term poetic prose springs to mind. In the hands of another author, <i>Westlake Soul</i> might have floundered. It is ambitious, thought-provoking, and by the protagonist&#x2019;s very nature a difficult story to write. Youers possesses a skill that, despite the adult themes presented, never makes it a chore. There&#x2019;s a light-hearted approach in the writing style, a kind of cool touch that makes <i>Westlake Soul</i> a powerful and engrossing read.

In 1973 Broughton Coburn lived and taught&nbsp;&nbsp;school in a subsistence farming village on the edge&nbsp;&nbsp;of Nepal's Himalayan mountains. It was there that&nbsp;&nbsp;he met and developed a unique friendship with a&nbsp;&nbsp;septuagenarian native widow named Vishnu Maya&nbsp;&nbsp;Gurung, fondly known to her relatives and locals as Aama&nbsp;&nbsp;(mother). When Coburn moved into the hay loft&nbsp;&nbsp;above her water buffalo shed, Aama became his&nbsp;&nbsp;landlady, but she also treated him like the son she never&nbsp;&nbsp;had. Having lost his own mother shortly before he&nbsp;&nbsp;met Aama, Coburn took an instant liking to the&nbsp;&nbsp;sprightly Nepalese woman. Already a success in two&nbsp;&nbsp;previous small press editions, <i>Nepali&nbsp;&nbsp;Aama</i> is Coburn's enchanting account of his&nbsp;&nbsp;experiences living, working, and traveling with Aama,&nbsp;&nbsp;illustrated with his own photos and Aama's candid,&nbsp;&nbsp;sometimes salty, often hilarious observations on&nbsp;&nbsp;everyday life in the rural third world. By&nbsp;&nbsp;combining Aama's deep-rooted wisdom with his striking&nbsp;&nbsp;black-and-white photographs, Coburn places the reader&nbsp;&nbsp;in a setting that few have ever experienced. He&nbsp;&nbsp;also offers rare insight into a culture alive with&nbsp;&nbsp;humor, folklore, and&nbsp;&nbsp;religion.<br><br>"Aama and her people were poor and uneducated, but&nbsp;&nbsp;they seemed to possess an uncanny strength&nbsp;&nbsp;grounded in tradition, family, community, and&nbsp;&nbsp;self-sufficiency," he writes. "The values and&nbsp;&nbsp;philosophy that I have learned from Aama, her&nbsp;&nbsp;relatives, and the villagers are life lessons that are&nbsp;&nbsp;valuable in my own country, or wherever I go."</p><p>"Candid...humorous observations on every aspect of living."--<i>The Los Angeles Times</i>Brougnton Coburn spent fifteen years in Nepal volunteering for the Peace Corps and working for the United Nations, the World Wildlife Fund, and other agencies. He has gathered a treasury of photographs capturing Aama&#39;s spirit and that of the Gurung tribe.</p><h2>First Person Rural</h2><p>Having moved from New York fifteen years ago to become a Vermont farmer, Perrin recounts his mistakes in adjusting to country life and offers advice on such topics as sugaring, raising sheep, and making butter</p><p>A cross between Scott Nearing and E.B.

Taking place during the course of a year, her experiences range from the dramatic (a cyclone, a fire, the death of a family friend) to the ordinary (a cider pressing, the annual hog butchering, and the family's first look at the brand new Sears Roebuck catalog). Throughout, Rose is a changing, growing character. Her relationships with others evolve in a natural way that children are bound to relate to, and the awakening of her intellectual curiosity and her transition from childhood to adolescence is authentically depicted. MacBride is obviously fascinated with historical detail, which generally serves this book well, although its length will intimidate many children, and some of the descriptions are perhaps a bit too leisurely. The plotting is where the book lacks structure and cohesiveness; it is episodic to the point of being rambling, with some plot elements just fizzling out (for example, all of the little bits about omens and superstitions never lead up to anything). All in all, though, this is a respectable book worthy of consideration, especially where the series is already popular.?Lauralyn Persson, Wilmette Public Library, IL<br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>A T.

Central to such decisions, however, are the forces that determine what options show up on the agenda and what options do not even make it to the table. <i>Imperial Brain Trust</i>, published in 1977, is the classic study of the Council on Foreign Relations, an organization that has, for decades, played a central behind the scenes role is shaping such foreign policy choices. This private club and think tank, bringing together the New York establishment and the Washington foreign policy elite as well as other powerful forces, took the lead in laying out the plans for post-World II international order. The Council also traced the key guidelines for Cold War intervention and vetted and advised generations of White House officials. Rival think tanks, such as the far-right Heritage Foundation, now have a higher profile. But the Council on Foreign Relations continues to mark the boundaries of what insiders consider to be respectable foreign policy discussion, helping aspirants to policy influence test out their schemes for establishment approval.<p></p> <p>"...A thoroughly researched expose of the discreet workings of the powerful Council on Foreign Relations...an influential oligarchy which not only studies but forms U.S. policy.

An introspective weakling in thrall to his black-bladed, soul-eating sword, Stormbringer, he is yet a hero whose bloody adventures and wanderings through brooding, desolate lands leads inexorably to his decisive intervention in the war between the forces of Law and Chaos. This volume brings together The Stealer of Souls and Stormbringer, the first two published books of Elric&#x2019;s adventures, and confirms Michael Moorcock&#x2019;s place as one of the most important fantasy writers of our time.</p><p><i>Elric of Melnibon�</i> is a requisite title in the hard fantasy canon, a book no fantasy fan should leave unread. Author Michael Moorcock, already a major player in science fiction, cemented his position in the fantasy pantheon with the five-book Elric saga, of which <i>Elric of Melnibon�</i> is the first installment. The book's namesake, the brooding albino emperor of the dying nation of Melnibon�, is a sort of Superman for Goths, truly an archetype of the genre. <p> The youthful Elric is a cynical and melancholy king, heir to a nation whose 100,000-year rule of the world ended less than 500 years hence. More interested in brooding contemplation than holding the throne, Elric is a reluctant ruler, but he also realizes that no other worthy successor exists and the survival of his once-powerful, decadent nation depends on him alone. Elric's nefarious, brutish cousin Yrkoon has no patience for his physically weak kinsman, and he plots constantly to seize Elric's throne, usually over his dead body. <i>Elric of Melnibon�</i> follows Yrkoon's scheming, reaching its climax in a battle between Elric and Yrkoon with the demonic runeblades Stormbringer and Mournblade. In this battle, Elric gains control of the soul-stealing Stormbringer, an event that proves pivotal to the Elric saga. <i>--Paul Hughes</i></p>SALES POINTS * #17 in the Millennium Fantasy Masterworks series, a library of the most original and influential fantasy ever written * &#39;A work of powerful and sustained imagination which confirms Michael Moorcock&#39;s position as the most important successor to Mervyn Peake and Wyndham Lewis.

Highlights of this new edition include seven new garden designs by well-known landscape artists from around the country; over 75 new encyclopedia entries, with hundreds of new plants added; and three new chapters: Perennial Flower Finder, Perennial Combinations, and Growing with the Design. The result is a winning mix of information and inspiration-and beautiful color photographs-to take one's dream garden from concept to reality.</p><p>Perennials are the most challenging and rewarding of all garden plants, and most gardeners need all the help they can get to grow them well. Perennials emerge from the ground in early spring, grow to full height, bloom, bear fruit, and then disappear with the first frost, only to do the same thing the following year and again the next. Add this to the fact that for the first year or two, perennials don't do much above the ground (they are growing their root structure), but after that they burst forth with amazingly vigorous growth, and you get an idea of the pleasures and tribulations of perennial gardening. The rewards, however, are rich: a wide array of flower forms and colors, structure and leaf, an ever-changing mid-level tapestry in the garden, plus a celebration of seasonal change. Few gardeners can resist perennials, but how to grow them better and more effortlessly?<p> Readers can count on Rodale books to be practical and detailed and to advocate organic gardening. While <i>Rodale's Illustrated Encyclopedia of Perennials</i> does give information, as you would expect from Rodale, on soil building, climate, propagation and nontoxic pest and disease control, its emphasis is on design. The advice is down-to-earth, as in a sidebar entitled "Evergreen Perennials: Myth or Reality?" that points out that although some perennials are touted as evergreen, and do keep their leaves through the winter (such as Epimedium, Ajuga, and Bergenia), they are often so tattered by winter storms that they shouldn't be counted on to beautify the garden off-season.</p><p> Though packed with all sorts of useful information, the meat of the book is the encyclopedia of perennials. From acanthus to yucca, each comes with a color photo, cultural and cultivar information, as well as suggestions on use. <i>Rodale's Illustrated Encyclopedia of Perennials</i> is an invaluable reference for anyone interested in these rewarding, though somewhat demanding, plants. <i>--Valerie Easton</i></p>"<i>Rodale's Illustrated Encyclopedia of Perennials</i> is an excellent reference book for all gardeners, from the novice to the expert." -Dr. Allan M.

Apart from low clumps of grass, all I could see nearby was an ancient marker stone whose inscription was obscured by a coat of creeping mosses. Every part of me ached with weariness. "This is not even a settlement!" I protested. "It's&#x2014;it's nowhere!"</p> <p>"This is as far west as your money takes you," the man said flatly. "Wasn't that the agreement? It's late. I won't linger in these parts after nightfall."</p> <p>I sat frozen. He couldn't really be going to leave me in this godforsaken spot, could he?</p> <p>"You could come on with me." The man's tone had changed. "I've got a roof, supper, a comfortable bed. For a pretty little thing like you, there's other ways of paying." He set a heavy hand on my shoulder, making me shrink away, my heart hammering. I scrambled down from the cart and seized my bag and writing box from the back before the fellow could drive off and leave me with nothing.</p> <p>"Sure you won't change your mind?" he asked, eyeing me up and down as if I were a prime cut of beef.</p> <p>"Quite sure," I said shakily, shocked that I had been too full of my woes to notice that look in his eye earlier, when there were other passengers on the cart. "What is this place? Is there a settlement close by?"</p> <p>"If you can call it that." He jerked his head in the general direction of the marker. "Don't know if you'll find shelter. They've a habit of huddling behind locked doors at night around here, and with good reason. I'm not talking about troops of armed Normans on the road, you understand, but . . . something else. You'd far better come home with me. I'd look after you."</p> <p>I slung my bundle over my shoulder. On the tip of my tongue was the retort he deserved: I'm not so desperate, but I was not quite brave enough to say it. Besides, with only four coppers left and the very real possibility that pursuit was close behind me, I might soon be reduced to accepting offers of this kind or starving.</p> <p>I stooped to examine the weathered stone, keeping a wary eye on the carter. He wouldn't attack me, would he? Out here, I would scream unheard. The stone's inscription read Whistling Tor. An odd name. As I traced the moss-crusted letters, the man drove away without another word. The drum of hoof beats and the creak of wheels diminished to nothing. I took a deep breath and ordered myself to be strong. If there was a sign, there must be a settlement and shelter.</p> <p>I headed off along the misty track to Whistling Tor. I had hoped to reach the settlement quite quickly, but the path went on and on, and after a while it began to climb. As I made my way up, I could see through the mist that I was walking into ever denser woodland, the dark trunks of oak and beech looming here and there above a smothering blanket of bushes and briars. My shawl kept catching on things. I wrenched it away with my free hand, the other holding tight to my writing box. I stumbled. There were odd stones on the path, pale, sharp-edged things that seemed set down deliberately to trip the unwary traveller.</p> <p>The last light was fading. Here under the trees, the shadows and the mist combined to make the only safe speed a cautious creep. If only I were not so tired. I'd been up at first light after an uncomfortable night spent in the rough shelter of a dry-stone wall. I'd walked all morning. At the time, the carter had seemed a godsend.</p> <p>Footsteps behind me. What now? Hide in the cover of the trees until the person had passed? No. I had made a promise to myself when I fled Market Cross, and I must keep it. I will be brave. I halted and turned.</p> <p>A tall man emerged from the mist, shoulders square, walking steadily. I had just time to take in his impressive garb&#x2014;a cloak dyed brilliant crimson, a chain around his neck that appeared to be of real gold&#x2014;when a second man came up behind him. Relief washed through me. This one, shorter and slighter than the other, was clad in the brown habit and sandals of a monastic brother. They halted four paces away from me, looking mildly surprised. The deepening dusk and the rising mist rendered both their faces ghostly pale, and the monk was so thin his features seemed almost skeletal, but his smile was warm.</p> <p>"Well, well," he observed. "The mist has conjured a lovely lady from an ancient tale, my friend. We must be on our best manners or she'll set a nasty spell on us, I fear."</p> <p>The red-cloaked man made an elegant bow. "My friend has a penchant for weak jests," he said. He did not smile&#x2014;his face was a sombre one, thin-lipped, sunken-eyed&#x2014;but his manner was courteous. "We see few travellers on this path. Are you headed for the settlement?"</p> <p>"Whistling Tor? Yes. I was hoping to find shelter for the night."</p> <p>They exchanged a glance.</p> <p>"Easy to lose yourself when the mist comes down," the monk said. "The settlement's on our way, more or less. If you permit, we'll walk with you and make sure you get there safely."</p> <p>"Thank you. My name is Caitrin, daughter of Berach."</p> <p>"Rioghan," said the tall man in the crimson cloak. "My companion is Eichri. Let me carry that box for you."</p> <p>"No!" Nobody was getting his hands on my writing materials. "No, thank you," I added, realising how sharp I had sounded. "I can manage."</p> <p>We walked on. "Do you live somewhere locally?" I asked the two men.</p> <p>"Close at hand," Rioghan said. "But not in the settlement. When you get there, ask for Tomas. He's the innkeeper."</p> <p>I nodded, wondering if four coppers would be enough to buy me a bed for the night. I waited for them to ask me why a young woman was out wandering alone so late in the day, but neither of them said a thing more, though each glanced at me from time to time as we walked on. I sensed my arrival was a curiosity to them, something that went beyond the obvious puzzle of my appearance. When I'd fled from Market Cross I'd looked like what I was, the daughter of a skilled craftsman, a girl of good family, neat and respectable. Now I was exhausted and dishevelled, my clothing creased and muddy. My boots had not handled the long walk well. The manner of my departure had left me ill equipped for travel. Of my small store of coins, all but those four coppers had been spent on getting me to this point. A new idea came to me.</p> <p>"Brother Eichri?"</p> <p>"Yes, Caitrin, daughter of Berach?"</p> <p>"I imagine you are attached to a monastery or similar, somewhere near here. Is there also a Christian place of scholarship and retreat for women?"</p> <p>The monk smiled. He had teeth like miniature tombstones; they made his features look even more gaunt. "Not within several days' ride, Caitrin. You seek to enter a life of prayer?"</p> <p>I blushed. "I would hardly be qualified for that. What faith I once had, I have no longer. I thought it possible such a place might offer refuge . . . Never mind." It had been a mistake to ask such a question. The less people knew about my woeful position the better. I'd been stupid to give these two my real name, friendly as they were.</p> <p>"Are you in need of funds, Caitrin?" Rioghan's question was blunt.</p> <p>"No." The carter had made me wary. Rioghan's good manners did not necessarily mean he was trustworthy. "I'm a craftswoman," I added. "I earn my own living."</p> <p>"Ah." That was all he said, and it pleased me. No intrusive questions; no laughter at the idea that a woman could survive on her own without resorting to selling her body. For the first time in many days I felt almost at ease.</p> <p>We walked on in silence. I could not help staring at Rioghan's crimson cloak. The fabric was silky and sumptuous, most likely a cloth imported from a far land at fabulous cost. But the garment was sadly worn, almost to holes here and there. Did Rioghan have nobody to do his mending? A person who wore such an extravagant item, not to speak of the gold around his neck, must surely have servants at his beck and call.</p> <p>He saw me looking. "A badge of authority," he said, and there was a note of terrible sadness in his tone. "I was once a king's chief councillor."</p> <p>It was hard to find the right response without asking awkward questions. Why once and not now? Rioghan did not look terribly old, only sad and unwell, his pallid complexion adding to that impression. Connacht was ruled by kings of the U� Conchubhair; Ruaridh had been high king for many years. There would be chieftains ruling each region in these parts. As I had travelled westwards I had seen palisades of sharpened sticks encircling villages. I had seen folk digging trenches and raising defensive mounds around the mud and wattle strongholds of local leaders. If ever a king needed his chief councillor it was now, with the Norman invaders eyeing this last untouched part of the land. Had Rioghan fallen out of favour with his leader? Been supplanted by an abler man?</p> <p>"I'm sorry if I was staring," I said as we took a branch of the track that headed downhill. Below us, looming shapes in the mist suggested we were at last close to the settlement of Whistling Tor. "That is such a fine red. I was just wondering what the dyestuff was."</p> <p>"Ah," said Rioghan. "You're a weaver? A spinner?"</p> <p>"Neither. But I'm interested in colours. Is that the village?"</p> <p>The two of them halted on either side of me and I paused, looking ahead. A formidable barrier surrounded the modest settlement, a conglomeration of sharp-pointed stakes, iron bars, splintery old gates and other lethal bits and pieces. The mist shifted around it, revealing here a broken plough, there a great jagged stone that must have taken the efforts of eight or ten men to haul into place. As a fortification against the Normans the barrier probably wouldn't last long, but it made a powerful deterrent to travellers. The place was set about with flaming torches on tall poles.</p> <p>"It seems the folk of Whistling Tor don't like visitors," I said flatly. "Since I'm with you, I suppose it will be all right." Within that wall I could see men moving about, but the mist made details obscure. I headed on down the hill towards the barrier, my two companions behind me.</p> <p>I was about twelve paces from the wall when something hurtled over it towards me. I ducked, shielding my head. A sizeable stone hit the ground not far away, followed by several smaller ones. Someone shouted from within the barrier, "Not a step further! Spawn of the devil, away with you!"</p> <p>Blessed Brighid, what was this? Trembling, I peered out between my sheltering hands. Four or five men stood on the other side of the fortification, their faces uniformly ash white, their weapons at the ready: a pitchfork, a scythe, an iron bar, a club with spikes. "Away with you, scum!" yelled one, and another added, "Go back where you belong, into the pit of hell!"</p> <p>Had the mist transformed me into a monster? <i>Run, Caitrin, run</i>! No; I must be brave. I cleared my throat. "I'm just a . . ." I faltered. <i>A wandering scribe </i> might be the truth, but nobody was going to believe it. "A traveller. On my way to visit kinsfolk. My name is Caitrin, daughter of Berach." Curses, I'd done it again, used my real name. <i>Pull yourself together, Caitrin</i>. "I need shelter for the night. I mean no harm here." I glanced over my shoulder, wondering why Rioghan and Brother Eichri had not spoken up on my behalf, but nobody was there. While the inhabitants of Whistling Tor village were hurling stones and insults, my two companions had made a silent departure.</p> <p>All alone. No one to turn to but myself. That was nothing new; I had been all alone at Market Cross, in a house full of folk. Should I run? Where? <i>Speak up, Caitrin</i>. This couldn't be what it seemed, surely. It was some kind of mistake, that was all. "It's the truth!" I added. "Please let me in." I remembered something. "Might I speak to Tomas?"</p> <p>The men of the settlement stood close together, eyeing me. They looked both combative and terrified. This didn't make sense. What did they think I was, a one-woman raiding party? I shivered, hugging my shawl around me, as they held a muttered consultation.</p> <p>"Where did you say you were headed?" The man with the club asked the question without quite looking me in the eye.</p> <p>"I didn't," I said. "But my mother's kin live in these parts." That was not quite a lie: my mother's family had indeed lived in the far west of Connacht, but there were none of them left now, at least none I knew of.</p> <p>"Fetch Tomas," someone said. A lull, then; no more missiles thrown, but plenty of talk in low, agitated voices on that side of the barrier, while on this side I stood waiting as the last light faded. I wondered how much longer my legs would hold me up.</p> <p>"What are you?" A new voice. Another man had joined the first group, an older man with a more capable manner. "Ordinary folk don't come to Whistling Tor. Especially not after dark."</p> <p>"Are you Tomas?" I asked. "My name is Caitrin. I've been on the road all day. I just need somewhere to sleep. I can pay."</p> <p>"If you mean no harm, prove it," someone called out.</p> <p>"How?" I wondered if I would be subjected to a search or other indignities when I got through the defensive barrier. Well-born young women did not usually travel alone. It would be plain to everyone that I was in some kind of trouble. After today it was all too easy to believe men would interpret that as an invitation.</p> <p>"Say a Christian prayer." That was the man with the club, his voice still thick with unease.</p> <p>I stared at him. Whatever these villagers were afraid of, it seemed it was not the Normans, for the most part a Christian -people. "God in heaven," I said, "guide and support me on my journey and bring me safely to shelter. Blessed Saint Patrick shield me. Mother Mary intercede for me. Amen."</p> <p>There was a pause, then the man with the club lowered his weapon, and the older one said, "Let her through, boys. Duald, make sure the barrier's properly sealed afterwards. You can't be too careful in this mist. Go on, let her in."</p> <p>"If you're sure, Tomas."</p> <p>Various bars and logs and pieces of metal were moved apart, and I was admitted to the safe ground within. "This way," Tomas said as I murmured thanks.</p> <p>He walked by my side through the village. The houses were bristling with protective measures, the kind used by superstitious folk: triangles of iron nails, bowls of white stones set under steps, other charms to ward off evil. Doors and shutters were tightly closed. Many were barred with iron. What with the shifting light from the torches and the gathering mist, there was a nightmarish quality about the place. In the centre of the settlement stood a bigger building, solidly built of mud and wattle and roofed with rain-darkened thatch.</p> <p>"Whistling Tor Inn," my companion said. "I'm the innkeeper; my name's Tomas. We can give you a bed for the night."</p> <p>Tears pricked my eyes. I'd been beginning to think I had strayed into a different world, one where everything was awry. "Thank you," I said.</p> <p>The inn was locked up. A wary-looking woman opened the door at Tomas's call, and I was ushered into a kitchen where a warm fire burned on the hearth. ...</p></p><h2>Illustrated Stories For Girls</h2><p>This magical collection contains fourteen fantastic tales of pretty princesses, determined fairies, brave dolls and clever mermaids.

At the same time, Cambridge is plagued by a mystery thief, who is targetting rich pilgrims. Moreover, pranksters are at large in the University, staging a series of practical jokes that are growing increasingly dangerous, and that are dividing scholars into bitterly opposed factions. Bartholomew and Michael soon learn that their various mysteries are connected, and it becomes a race against time to catch the killer-thief before the university explodes into a violent conflict that could destroy it forever.</p><p><p>Susanna Gregory is a Cambridge academic&nbsp;and the author of the Thomas Chaloner series.</p>Starred Review. British author Gregory again displays her mastery of complex storytelling and period detail in her 16th mystery set in 14th-century Cambridge, the home of doctor, instructor, and corpse examiner Matthew Bartholomew (after 2009's A Vein of Deceit). Amid an atmosphere of increasing tension between Cambridge's colleges and the less affluent hostels, Bartholomew must identify the killer of taverner John Drax, who was initially believed the victim of an accident, until the physician found a fatal stab wound on his body. For many, the book's pleasures will stem less from the resolution of the various interlocking puzzles than from the utterly convincing portrait of an England still recovering from the great pestilence of the previous decade, complete with familiar complaints about the timeliness of home contractors' work and avaricious people seeking to profit from the tragic plague. Unlike in many other long-running series, newcomers will find nothing inaccessible in this installment. (Nov.) (c) <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It&#39;s the late 1960s and homosexuality has only just been legalised, and Jeremy Thorpe, the leader of the Liberal party, has a secret he&#39;s desperate to hide. As long as Norman Scott, his beautiful, unstable lover is around, Thorpe&#39;s brilliant career is at risk. With the help of his fellow politicians, Thorpe schemes, deceives, embezzles - until he can see only one way to silence Scott for good. The trial of Jeremy Thorpe changed our society forever: it was the moment the British public discovered the truth about its political class. Illuminating the darkest secrets of the Establishment, the Thorpe affair revealed such breath-taking deceit and corruption in an entire section of British society that, at the time, hardly anyone dared believe it could be true. A Very English Scandal is an eye-opening tale of how the powerful protect their own, and an extraordinary insight into the forces that shaped modern Britain.</p><p>John Preston is a former Arts Editor of the Evening Standard and the Sunday Telegraph.

A Portrait by His Daughter</h2><p>The daughter of the composer chronicles his life, discussing his Broadway hits, his fiery temper, and his personal life. 25,000 first printing. $25,000 ad/promo. Tour.</p><p>Engaging life of brilliant lyricist, songwriter, and composer Frank Loesser (1910-69), whose genius with words brings life to this loving biography by his daughter (a journalist, editor, geologist, etc., who's been published in Life and Family Circle). Much of the charm here lies in Frank Loesser's never failing ingenuity as Susan Loesser quotes his lyrics, letters, and notes for stage productions. The composer spent his life in the emotional shadow of his older brother Arthur, a gifted classical pianist and teacher, and of their mother, Julia, for whom young Frank's Pulitzer-winning Broadway endeavors lacked intellectual refinement. Loesser could never satisfy either family member, even when his most ambitious work, The Most Happy Fella, was praised for its immense variety of musical forms and operatic scope. Loesser, though an apparent egomaniac, thought himself a comparative failure and would put himself down as just an entertainer writing for the moment, future glory not required. Meanwhile, the composer's first wife, Mary, Susan's mother, who was ``pathologically meticulous,'' survived her divorce from Frank by resorting to alcohol and working as a tough-talking Broadway producer. Loesser was a famous Hollywood lyricist before making the big leap to Broadway with Where's Charley?, writing both music and lyrics, then with the quintessential New York musical, Guys and Dolls, his greatest hit. Throughout, the author quotes passages cut out of her father's shows, including from How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying. The composer died of cancer at 59--when, we learn, he was already being swamped from all sides by detested rock music that was making him old hat. Though foulmouthed, Loesser grows on you wonderfully through his daughter's eyes. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>In this engaging biography, the daughter of popular composer and lyricist Frank Loesser (1910-1969) recalls her father's life and work, weaving into the story an account of her own difficult childhood, which was marred by the alcoholism of her mother and the divorce of her parents. In his pursuit of a career in the theater, Loesser broke away from the conventions of his intellectual Manhattan family and affected a Lower East Side accent and a working-class persona. Nevertheless, even after achieving success with such Broadway hits as Guys and Dolls, The Most Happy Fella and How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying , he struggled to win the respect of his brother, a critic and musicologist who disdained popular music, and of his mother, who was equally scornful of his work. Loesser was a difficult man with a violent temper, but he could be a loving father, and his daughter, a freelance writer, tells her tale with affection in a lively book studded with humorous anecdotes and numerous lyrics from her father's memorable songs.

Lewis's biting satire received a 1999 Grammy nomination for best spoken-word performance, and it's easy to see why--the story fits the format perfectly. It's relatively brief (the unabridged reading takes a mere four hours), and contains only one character--the demon Screwtape, who writes letters to his novice nephew Wormwood, instructing him on how to best tempt his "patient" (a wayward soul on earth) into the bosom of "our Lord below." <p> Obviously, the book wasn't written with former Monty Python John Cleese in mind, but it's hard to imagine a better Screwtape. Cleese's voice provides the perfect vehicle for Lewis's dry, razor-edged wit. His uncanny comic timing and ability to milk each phrase for maximum effect betray an infectious enthusiasm for the story. It's clear that he's having a great time reading, and it's impossible not to laugh along with him. This inspired pairing of two of the 20th century's greatest wits makes for a meditation on the dark side of spiritual guidance that's as relevant and funny today as it was in Lewis's war-torn England. (Running time: 4 hours, 3 cassettes) --<i>Andrew Neiland</i></p>His letters are signed, save one, "Your affectionate uncle", yet Uncle Screwtape's purposes in writing to his young nephew are hardly innocent. Penned in a brisk, businesslike style, old Screwtape offers the gullible Tempter Wormword fiendishly clever advice on his most pressing concern: the winning of young lives to the devil.<p>First published in 1941, The Screwtape Letters, a perennial best seller, has earned a place in the library of classics. The truths contained in C. S. Lewis's treatise on human nature are as old as the world, but his witty observations continue to confront and challenge believers and nonbelievers alike.</p><p>The outcome of Screwtape's correspondence is not known. But judging from his final signoff -- "Your increasingly and ravenously affectionate uncle" -- his appetite for evil has not lessened.</p></p><h2>My Heart and Other Black Holes (English Edition)</h2><p>My Heart and Other Black Holes</p><p><p>Sixteen-year-old physics nerd Aysel is obsessed with plotting her own death.

But once she discovers a website with a section called Suicide Partners, Aysel's convinced she's found her solution&#x2014;a teen boy with the username FrozenRobot (aka Roman), who's haunted by a family tragedy, is looking for a partner.</p><p>Even though Aysel and Roman have nothing in common, they slowly start to fill in each other's broken lives. But as their suicide pact becomes more concrete, Aysel begins to question whether she really wants to go through with it. Ultimately, she must choose between wanting to die or trying to convince Roman to live so they can discover the potential of their energy together.</p><p>This is a gorgeously written and compulsively readable novel about the transformative power of love, heralding the arrival of an extraordinary new voice in teen fiction, Jasmine Warga.</p>Jasmine Warga lives in Mariemont, Ohio with her husband, Greg, a cat named Salvador Dali, and a puppy named Scout.

More than 56,000 British and Commonwealth aircrew and 600,000 Germans died in the course of the RAF's attempt to win the war by bombing. The struggle in the air began meekly in 1939 with only a few Whitleys, Hampdens, and Wellingtons flying blindly through the night on their ill-conceived bombing runs. It ended six years later with 1,600 Lancasters, Halifaxes, and Mosquitoes, equipped with the best of British wartime technology, blazing whole German cities in a single night. Bomber Command, through its fits and starts, grew into an effective fighting force.

Everyday Christians, however, are not privy to this deeper conversation. It is for these people that renowned bishop and author John Shelby Spong presents <em>Re-Claiming the Bible for a Non-Religious World</em>, a book designed to take readers into the contemporary academic debate about the Bible.</p><p>A definitive voice for progressive Christianity, Spong frees readers from a literal view of the Bible. He opens the possibility that some of the characters in the New Testament are imaginary composites or even literary creations&#x2014;such as Joseph, the earthly father of Jesus; Judas Iscariot; Nicodemus; the Samaritan woman by the well; and Lazarus who was raised from the dead. He presents the Bible as an ever-changing and always growing story. He demonstrates that it is possible to be both a deeply committed Christian and an informed twenty-first-century citizen.</p><p>In this thorough, substantive guide, Spong explores the origin and essential meaning of each of the individual books in the Bible, examining the background, the context, the level of authenticity and even the trustworthiness of the messages found there. He explains why these particular books, written between two and three thousand years ago, came to be regarded as authoritative and preserved as sacred; he traces the pathway that biblical religion has traveled as it evolved through the centuries, and he shows how people have misused many of these texts in the service of their prejudices.</p><p>Reaching far beyond the familiar Sunday-school stories that have provided the content of most people&#x2019;s biblical knowledge, Spong&#x2019;s journey into the heart of the Bible is his attempt to call his readers into their own journeys into the mystery of God. &#x201c;One does not,&#x201d; he asserts, &#x201c;have to twist one&#x2019;s brain into a first-century pretzel in order to take the Bible seriously in this increasingly non-religious world.&#x201d;</p><p>John Shelby Spong, the Episcopal Bishop of Newark before his retirement in 2000, has been a visiting lecturer at Harvard and at more than 500 other universities all over the world. His books, which have sold well over a million copies, include <em>Biblical Literalism: A Gentile Heresy; The Fourth Gospel: Tales of a Jewish Mystic; Re-Claiming the Bible for a Non-Religious World; Eternal Life: A New Vision; Jesus for the Non-Religious, The Sins of Scripture, Resurrection: Myth or Reality?; Why Christianity Must Change or Die;</em> and his autobiography, <em>Here I Stand</em>.

"The free men of the world are marching together to Victory!" General Dwight David Eisenhower exhorted his troops before the D-Day invasion. But the commanding words that sent Robinson on his way this cool, gray morning were uttered by a humble secretary. </p><p> Come to Brooklyn, she said. </p><p> He showered and shaved and hurried out of the hotel. He was on his way to meet Branch Rickey, president and part owner of the Brooklyn Dodgers, and to learn whether Rickey was ready to end the segregation of the races in big-league baseball. </p><p> In 1947, some southern states still denied the vote to black Americans. Black children were not entitled to attend the same schools as white children. Lynch mobs executed their own bloodthirsty style of justice while local law enforcement officials looked the other way. "I'm sorry, but they done got him," one sheriff in North Carolina announced that year after a gang of white men made off with one of his prisoners. Black Americans were excluded not only from certain schools but also from parks, beaches, playgrounds, department stores, night clubs, swimming pools, roller-skating rinks, theaters, rest rooms, barber shops, railroad cars, bus seats, military units, libraries, factory floors, and hospitals. In the North, WHITES ONLY signs were far less evident than in the South, but the veiled message was often the same. Black men on business in Chicago, Detroit, or Cleveland usually stayed in black-owned hotels, rode in black-owned taxis, and dined in black-owned restaurants. If a white man became acquainted with a black man, odds were good that the acquaintance stemmed from some service the black man performed for the white man -- shining his shoes, for example, or mowing his lawn, or mixing his cocktails. </p><p> Segregation suffused the nation's culture, and yet profound changes were rippling across the country. Black workers moved from South to North in great waves, reshaping urban spaces and lending new muscle to organized labor. Black soldiers coming home from the war declared they would no longer tolerate second-class citizenship. Federal judges commanded southern states to stop obstructing the black vote. President Truman signed an order to end segregation in the military. And in major-league baseball, where there were sixteen teams and every player on every one of those teams was white, a single black man was presented an opportunity to change the equation: to make it one black man and 399 white. </p><p> The test case represented by Jackie Robinson was one of towering importance to the country. Here was a chance for one person to prove the bigots and white supremacists wrong, and to say to the nation's fourteen million black Americans that the time had come for them to compete as equals. But it would happen only if a long list of "ifs" worked out just so: <i>if</i> the Brooklyn Dodgers gave Robinson the opportunity to play; <i>if</i> he played well; <i>if</i> he won the acceptance of teammates and fans; <i>if</i> no race riots erupted; <i>if</i> no one put a bullet through his head. The "ifs" alone were enough to agitate a man's stomach. Then came the matter of Robinson himself. He perceived racism in every glare, every murmur, every called third strike. He was not the most talented black ballplayer in the country. He had a weak throwing arm and a creaky ankle. He had only one year of experience in the minor leagues, and, at twenty-eight, he was a little bit old for a first-year player. But he loved a fight. His greatest assets were tenacity and a knack for getting under an opponent's skin. He would slash a line drive to left field, run pigeon-toed down the line, take a big turn at first base, slam on the brakes, and skitter back to the bag. Then, as the pitcher prepared to go to work on the next batter, Robinson would take his lead from first base, bouncing on tiptoes like a dropped rubber ball, bouncing, bouncing, bouncing, taunting the pitcher, and daring everyone in the park to guess when he would take off running again. While other men made it a point to avoid danger on the base paths, Robinson put himself in harm's way every chance he got. His speed and guile broke down the game's natural order and left opponents cursing and hurling their gloves. When chaos erupted, that's when he knew he was at his best. </p><p> On that April 10 morning, as he rode the subway from Manhattan to Brooklyn, Robinson understood exactly what he was getting into. One prominent black journalist had written that the ballplayer had more power than Congress to help break the chains that bound the descendants of slavery to lives lived in inequity and despair. Before he'd even swung a bat in the big leagues, Robinson was being compared to Frederick Douglass, George Washington Carver, and Joe Louis, with some writers concluding that this man would do more for his people than any of the others. The time had come, they said, for black Americans to stake their claim to the justice and equal rights they so richly deserved, and now a baseball player had arrived to show them the way. Robinson absorbed the newspaper articles. He felt the weight on his shoulders and decided there was nothing to do but carry it as fast and as far as he could. </p><p> A cold wind met him as he climbed out of the subway onto the busy streets of Brooklyn. He walked to 215 Montague Street. Waiting for him there was Branch Rickey, a potato-shaped man in a wrinkled suit. The office was dark and cluttered. Rickey got straight to business, offering Robinson a standard contract for five-thousand dollars, the league's minimum annual salary. </p><p> "Simple, wasn't it?" Robinson recalled later. "It could have happened to you. The telephone rings. You answer it . . . and you're in the Big Leagues. . . . Just like a fairy tale. . . . I went to bed one night wearing pajamas and woke up wearing a Brooklyn Dodgers' uniform." </p><p> He knew it was no fairy tale, of course. He knew that a happy ending was far from assured. Most big-leaguers in 1947 had never been on the same field as a black man, had never shared a locker room, a shower, a taxi, a train car, or a dining-room table with one. Big-league culture was so thoroughly dominated by white southerners that even rough Italian kids from northern cities experienced shock and isolation upon arrival. There was no telling how Robinson would be received. He was not yet a member of the Brooklyn Dodgers, and already half a dozen or more of his prospective teammates promised they would quit or demand a trade before they would play with him. Elsewhere, players spoke of a league-wide strike. They were willing to destroy the game they loved rather than see it stained by integration. Others said it would be simpler to take Robinson out with a well-aimed fastball to the head, or with a set of metal cleats driven through his Achilles tendon on a close play at first base -- something that would look like an accident. </p><p> Rickey made only one demand of Robinson. He asked the ballplayer to promise that he would never respond to the racist attacks that would surely come his way. When Rickey quoted a passage from Giovanni Papini's <i>Life of Christ</i> -- "But whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also" -- Robinson sought clarification. Did Rickey want a player who didn't have the guts to fight back? No, the boss answered, "I want a ballplayer with guts enough <i>not</i> to fight back." </p><p> Rickey turned and walked away while Robinson thought about it for a moment. Though the request would require Robinson to subdue his most basic instincts, and though he had no idea, honestly, whether he could compete without an outlet for his seething sense of indignation, he said he would try. With that, the season's storyline was set. </p><p> Robinson became baseball's biggest attraction in 1947. According to one survey, he was the second most famous man in America, trailing only Bing Crosby. Americans yearned for a sense of normalcy in the aftermath of the war, yet everything around them was in flux. Robinson, a human whirlwind, captured the spirit of the time better than anyone. When the Dodgers went on the road, thousands of black men and women traveled great distances to get a glimpse of him, as if to see for themselves that he was real, to share his dignity and glory, to watch this proud, defiant man, the grandson of slaves, stake a claim on their behalf to what Langston Hughes called "the dream deferred." Railroad companies scheduled special runs. Black parents named their children, boys and girls, after him. White kids from small towns in the Midwest sat surrounded by black men and women at the ballpark and wondered why their parents seemed anxious. Jewish families in Brooklyn gathered around their dining-room tables for Passover Seders and discussed what Moses had in common with a fleet-footed, right-hand-hitting infielder with the number 42 on his back. White business owners integrated their factory floors and wrote to Robinson to thank him for opening their eyes. Young ballplayers of every color imitated his style, wiping their hands on their trousers between pitches, swinging with arms outstretched, and running helter-skelter around makeshift bases. </p><p> Jackie Robinson showed that talent mattered more than skin color, supplying a blueprint for the integration of a nation. He led the Dodgers to the greatest season the team's fans had yet seen, to a World Series sho...</p></p><h2>365 Skinny Smoothies: Delicious Recipes to Help You Get Slim and Stay Healthy Every Day of the Year</h2><p><br><br><em>A SMOOTHIE A DAY KEEPS THE FAT AWAY</em><br><br>Forget those 700-calorie "healthy" smoothies you've been drinking.

We each have different and specific nutritional needs. For example, at any given point in time we may have nutrient deficiencies, or our metabolism may be effected by toxins or our immune systems may be triggered by food allergens. You can test your metabolism by experimenting with the following strategies to see what works for you. For example, reducing exposure to toxins will help some people shed pounds immediately, while others see more weight loss when they avoid foods they're allergic to. You'll know you're impacting your ability to lose weight when you start to shed pounds.<br><br><strong>MINIMIZE SUGAR</strong><br><br>Simple sugar is unhealthy because it delivers empty calories (calories without nutrients), and raises cholesterol and triglyceride levels, causing insulin resistance, inflammation and insulin fluctuations that can lead to weight gain. To monitor your intake of sugar, check the sugar content on food labels. Keep in mind that sugars are simple carbohydrates and are included in the total number of carbohydrates listed on a label.<br><br>Our daily recommended carbohydrate intake, which includes fruits and vegetables, is calculated based on our size and activity level. The American Diabetes Association recommends about 45-60 grams of carbohydrate at a meal. All of the smoothies in this book provide the number of grams of carbs per serving. This carb number includes both complex carbohydrates, such as those from whole fruits, as well as sugars from fruit juices. My recipes contain between 15 and 30 carbs per smoothie, which is clearly well under the ADA's recommended intake. I have carefully designed the smoothies in this book to be low carb and low calorie.<br><br><strong>ADD PROTEIN TO SMOOTHIES TO INCREASE MUSCLE AND DECREASE FAT</strong><br><br>Adding protein to smoothies supplies the amino acids we need for efficient weight loss. Studies show that protein reduces the appetite as well as food cravings, and it also provides the amino acids that drive metabolism. The amount of protein we need varies depending on our activity level, age and gender but to give you a general idea, most adults need about 50 grams of dietary protein daily. To learn more check out the Centers for Disease Control (cdc gov), which provides a Recommended Dietary Allowance for Protein chart on their website.<br><br>The following chart provides some examples of my favorite sources of protein for smoothies.<br><br><table><tbody><tr> <td>Protein powders</td><td>14&#x2013;32 grams in 3 tablespoons</td></tr><tr><td>Greek yogurt</td><td>16&#x2013;20 grams in � cup</td></tr><tr><td>Cottage cheese</td><td>14 grams in � cup</td></tr><tr><td>Yogurt</td><td>10 grams in � cup</td></tr><tr><td>Hulled hemp seed</td><td>5&#x2013;7 grams in 2 tablespoons</td></tr><tr><td>Chia seed</td><td>6 grams in 2 tablespoons</td></tr><tr><td>Hemp protein powder</td><td>5 grams in 2 tablespoons</td></tr><tr><td>Nuts</td><td>5 grams in � cup</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><strong>DRINK PROTEIN WITH YOUR CARBS</strong><br><br>The ideal weight loss smoothie is low calorie and proteinenhanced to supply just enough fuel for consistent energy without the fat storage. Protein is a key macronutrient for weight loss, as it supplies amino acids that are the building blocks for many of the biological functions in our bodies. Increasing the protein in our diets helps provide the nutrients we need to keep our metabolism at peak performance. Protein foods, such as chia seed, hulled hemp seed and protein powders, can be added to smoothies to help balance the carbohydrates. Protein and fat help to slow the breakdown (digestion) of the entire meal, thus reducing the amount of sugar from the carbohydrate being released into the bloodstream at one time. Therefore, the protein helps give our metabolic processes time to use the calories from our food as energy rather than storing the calories as body fat.<br><br><strong>AVOID TOXINS TO LOSE WEIGHT MORE QUICKLY!</strong><br><br>Some toxins have a direct link to obesity, because they affect the liver. When the liver is busy cleaning up toxins, it can't properly break down insulin, which continues to circulate longer in your bloodstream, grabbing up sugar and storing it away as fat. The more toxins, the more body fat storage!<br><br><strong>GLASS IS HEALTHIER THAN PLASTIC</strong><br><br>Avoid phthalates, such as bisphenol A (BPA), which are toxins found in most plastics. Studies have found that exposure to these compounds through our food and water may be a causative factor in the development of obesity. You can minimize your exposure to these compounds by purchasing and storing foods and juices in glass rather than plastic. Foods and juices are increasingly available in glass containers, as many food product manufacturers are becoming aware of consumers' health concerns around the toxicity of plastics.<br><br><strong>BUY ORGANIC WHEN IT MATTERS</strong><br><br>Avoid agricultural chemicals by buying organic products. The Environmental Working Group (EWG.org) has a handy list of the "Dirty Dozen," which are the most heavily sprayed types of produce. For example, apples, celery, cherry tomatoes, cucumbers, grapes, hot peppers, nectarines, peaches, spinach and strawberries are all heavily sprayed, so it's best to buy organic. The USDA's "Organic" seal also lets you know a product is free of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), which is important because GMOs are inherently grown with the use of more agricultural chemicals than other types of crops. The EWG also provides a "Clean Fifteen" list, which is the least sprayed types of produce such as avocado, cantaloupe, grapefruit, kiwi, mango, papaya and pineapple. It's not as important to buy organic when it comes to these foods.<br><br><strong>SWEETEN WITH FIBER</strong><br><br>Sometimes we want to add a little sweetness to a smoothie. This can be done with fiber-rich foods such as dates, prunes and figs. They add sweet flavor but they break down slowly in our bodies because of their iber. This is a huge beneit because slowing the digestion of the carbohydrates gives our bodies longer lasting energy and less storage of body fat.<br><br><strong>BE A FOOD DETECTIVE: READ NUTRITION LABELS</strong><br><br>When you buy food products such as yogurt, be sure to read the "Nutrition Facts" labels to see how much sugar, fat and protein is in each serving. Some yogurts have as much sugar as a candy bar. And don't assume that less sugar equals low calorie. Often, sugar-free or reduced-sugar foods have even more calories than their original counterparts and may contain harmful artiicial sweeteners.<br><br>Nutrition facts food labels are on most food products and make it possible to calculate the macronutrient (carbohydrates, protein and fat) levels in each serving of that food or drink. It's important to be aware that the numbers listed reflect one serving. Always take a quick glance at the number of servings per container even when it seems like it should be obvious. For example, small bottles of juice that most of us would intend to drink as one serving are often designated as 2 or even 3 servings. This is common with food labeling. You can avoid this trap by simply being aware and looking at the number of servings and then multiplying the number of grams of carbs by the servings number to get the total number of carbs for that product.<br><br><strong>AVOID INFLAMMATION TRIGGERS AND LOSE WATER WEIGHT</strong><br><br>Inflammation is becoming a common health issue, as so many people suffer from food allergies and toxicities due to food processing and sugar content. Inflammation can cause bloating, joint pain, headaches, stiff back and cellulite. However, by reducing the body's inflammation, cellulite seems to magically disappear as we excrete extra water weight.<br><br>Therefore, avoid food allergens that cause inflammation. Some of the most common allergenic foods are wheat and gluten, corn, eggs, reined sugar, milk and soy. Many people who react to dairy foods can still digest yogurt, however. Yogurt is a cultured product, which means it contains pro-biotic organisms that help break down the natural sugars the lactose making it easier to digest and assimilate. In my nutrition practice, my clients have reported losing up to 15 pounds of water weight within days of removing an allergenic food from the diet. Keep this in mind as some of your "body fat" may just be water weight from inlammation.<br><br><strong>NUTRIENTS BOOST METABOLISM</strong><br><br>We use nutrients in our bodies 24/7. If we develop nutrient deficiencies, this can slow our metabolism down and even halt some systems. For example, protein, glutathione, zinc, chromium and B vitamins are all critical nutrients in metabolism. A high-quality daily supplement, such as MediClear powder from Thorne Research, can be added to smoothies and will replenish nutrients daily. Berries and other super-foods such as pomegranate, cinnamon and holy basil are so rich in nutrients that they're like an antioxidant supplement themselves, especially when eaten daily.<br><br><strong>DRINK YOUR SMOOTHIE IMMEDIATELY</strong><br><br><strong>AFTER BLENDING</strong><br><br>Smoothies do not travel well. The ingredients start to separate and oxidize almost immediately after blending. Try to drink your smoothies within a few minutes after blending while the nutrients are still fresh and vital.<br><br><strong>A SMOOTHIE A DAY IS THE SKINNY WAY</strong><br><br>Studies on the weight-loss effects of different food nutrients are continuously being reported. The research is very exciting, but keep in mind that the results are based on daily exposure to those nutrients. For example, we can't expect fiber or turmeric to help us lose weight if we ingest them only once a week. However, when we incorporate these nutrients into our daily routine, they can have a profound effect on our health. Our bodies are in a constant process of cell turnover, hormone production, and fat gain and release. By incorporating certain nutrients into our daily smoothies we support our bodies in the continual process of fat loss and muscle gain.<br><br><strong>PROBIOTICS ARE KEY TO DIGESTION AND WEIGHT LOSS</strong><br><br>There are thousands of different healthy bacteria that live in our gut, orchestrating our metabolic functions. Without proper gut flora we can't absorb nutrients such as polyphenols. Keep this in mind as you read about the powerful phy-tochemical nutrient studies throughout the book. We need a healthy gut flora for proper digestion and nutrient metabolism. We get these important organisms via cultured products such as cultured coconut milk, yogurt, kefir and supplements.<br><br><strong>A "SMOOTHIE SNACK" VS. A "SMOOTHIE MEAL"</strong><br><br>As mentioned in the Introduction, smoothies that are low in calories (fewer than 250 calories) are perfect little energizers between meals. Energy-dense smoothies with more than 250 calories can be used as meal replacements. Keep in mind that a 250 to 350 calorie smoothie is still fairly low in calories, and you may need to supplement it with a snack if you are active or have a higher calorie need. Most of the smoothies in this book are low-calorie energizers.<br><br><strong>EFAs HELP BURN BODY FAT</strong><br><br>We need essential fatty acids (EFAs) which are healthful fats from foods such as avocado, nuts and seeds for our skin and cells, nerves and fat-burning enzymes. EFAs are the essential oils/fats that we need to take in through our diet, as we can't produce these internally. Just one gram of EFAs per day appears to increase the production of fat-burning enzymes. One gram of EFAs is about 1 teaspoon of chia seed or 2 teaspoons of hulled hemp seed. In the recipes that follow, I generally recommend adding 1-2 tablespoons of chia seed, hulled hemp seed or protein powder to each smoothie to boost protein as well as EFAs.<br><br><strong>ADDING FIBER TO SMOOTHIES IS KEY TO BLOOD SUGAR CONTROL</strong><br><br>When we make smoothies, we're blending rather than juicing so that we retain the iber from the fruits and vegetables we're including. This is beneicial because essential minerals attach themselves to this fiber. Also fiber holds onto water as it moves through the digestive tract, helping us hydrate. This allows the body to absorb water as needed, which vastly improves hydration (see the discussion about the importance of hydration that follows). Additionally, when iber is added to a smoothie it helps reduce the glycemic load of the entire drink. The glycemic load is a system that assigns a number to specific foods based on how much they will increase a person's blood sugar level when eaten. For example, oranges are low at 40 while sugar is high at 100. When we add iber to our meals we can reduce the overall glycemic load of that meal, as fiber slows the breakdown of foods in the digestive tract. This slows the release of its nutrients into the bloodstream. Thus reducing the risk for a spike in blood sugar, which triggers the pancreas to respond with insulin. Once insulin has been released into the bloodstream, its job is to shunt the sugar into cells for energy and the excess is stored away as fat. Therefore, increasing iber in our meals and smoothies helps reduce the insulin response, which helps reduce the potential for calories to be stored away as body fat. There are many high-quality iber products on the market these days such as glucoman-nan, pectin, chicory fiber and acacia fiber that are gentle and dissolve well in smoothies.<br><br><strong>SMOOTHIES ENHANCE HYDRATION</strong><br><br>Dehydration may give us the false signal that we are hungry when actually we are simply thirsty and in need of water and possibly electrolytes. Coconut water, fruit juices, and fruits and vegetables will boost water content and electrolytes in smoothies. You can also stay hydrated by drinking filtered water throughout the day and adding ice to your smoothies. Ice also helps emulsify (blend together) the smoothie. Adding liquids to smoothies, such as green tea, herbal teas and coconut water, can also increase hydration.<br><br><strong>BREAKFAST KICK-STARTS YOUR METABOLISM</strong><br><br>Once you leave the house, the day can get pretty busy. You might eat out or forget to take supplements. Having a daily morning smoothie is an effective weight-loss strategy. By getting that morning boost of nutrients and protein, you'll be starting the day off right no matter where the day takes you. Eating breakfast, especially a high-protein breakfast, also helps those who have lost weight keep it off. Studies have found that people who miss their morning meal are more likely to be obese.<br><br><strong>INCREASE SPICES AND HERBS</strong><br><br><strong>BUT DECREASE SUGAR, FAT AND SALT</strong><br><br>Holy basil, turmeric powder and black pepper provide powerful nutrients for weight loss. The world's oldest medical system, the Ayurvedic Medicine system of India, uses culinary herbs daily for the prevention and treatment of disease and imbalance. In India they use turmeric and black pepper to reduce inflammation, and they use holy basil (Tulsi) to balance blood sugar. Holy basil is a medicinally potent herb that has an amazing fragrance and flavor and happens to be a perfect smoothie ingredient. Studies have found that its anti-oxidants have a ...</p><h2>Small Craft Advisory: A Book About the Building of a Boat</h2><p>Small Craft Advisory is an enchanting book about Louis Rubin&#x2019;s obsession with boats and his years of often hilarious boating adventures.<br><br>When Louis Rubin was thirteen, he built a leaky little boat and paddled it out to the edge of the ship channel in Charleston, South Carolina, where he felt the inexorable pull of the water. Fifty years and dozens of boats later sailboats, powerboats, inboards and outboards the pull is as strong as ever.<br><br>In the tradition established by Mark Twain, Joseph Conrad, and Herman Melville, distinguished author and scholar Louis Rubin explores man&#x2019;s longtime passion for boats. He examines the compulsion that has prompted him and hundreds of thousands of other non-nautical persons to spend so much time, and no small portion of their incomes, on watercraft that they can use only infrequently.<br><br>As his new boat (a cabin cruiser made of wood on a workboat hull) is being built, Rubin tells of his past boats and numerous boating disasters and draws a poignant comparison between his two passions: watercraft and the craft of writing.<br><br>Anyone who has ever bought and owned a boat or wondered why people are obsessed by them will love this amusing, evocative, beautifully crafted memoir by an inveterate boat-owner.<br></p><p>From the vantage of his mid-60s, critic, writer, and retired teacher Rubin (The Mockingbird in the Gum Tree, p. 997) offers a pleasantly rambling memoir about his lifelong romance with boats and about the building of what he suspects will be his last one, the wooden-hulled 24-footer Algonquin. As a young boy in Charleston, S.C., who lived on a river near the sea but couldn't swim a stroke, Rubin tacked together his first leaky skiff and tasted the romance of free movement on the water. Rubin never did learn to swim--a failure about which he's got some typically funny and modestly exploratory things to say--but from that time on he was never without a boat, or far from one. Entering retirement, and having gotten his children through college, he's now able to afford a boat that's an end-of-life equivalent of that childhood skiff--a craft at last that he can design and have built exactly the way he wants it. The result is the sturdy and unpretentious Algonquin, modeled after the harbor workboats that infatuated Rubin as a boy, and her construction from keel up (the boat is named for the publishing company of which Rubin is founder, and also for a coastal liner his father once took passage on) gives the author occasion to reminisce about his lifetime of boats before this one, with conversational side trips into books, places, the meaning of boats and travel, and even--by means of bits of family history that make up some of the most readable pages of this readable book--the psychology of risk-taking and the emotional roots of Rubin's constant but often impractical love of water and boats. Though maybe not casting its lines to quite the same historical breadth as Witold Rybczynski's The Most Beautiful House in the World (1989), this offers itself as a worthy and natural companion to that other andante and evocative memoir of the building of something much loved. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Rubin ( The Mockingbird in the Gum Tree: A Literary Gallimaufry , LJ 9/1/91) is a retired distinguished professor of literature, founder of Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill, and the author of numerous articles and 40 books. He also loves boats, especially unpretentious workboats, and has owned a dozen of them in his 67 years. He built a boat when he was 13, owned many used ones, and finally in 1990 had a new wooden 24-foot boat hand built for him. From his childhood boat to his latest one, the experience of boating has been an act of liberation, an elemental freedom which provides a theme for this memoir. His affection for old or old-style boats provides a noncompetitive counter to the stress and ambition of academic and business life. In describing the building of his boat he is describing the building of his life, reasserting the shaping value of memory and imagination. This gracefully written contemplation should be welcomed even in public libraries far from the sea.<br><i>- Roland Person, Southern Illinois Univ.

Now, in this important new book, he invites us to explore how a good society should operate and what values we must bring to our social interactions if we are to achieve stronger and more enduring community ties.As Etzioni has found in his years devoted to researching and studying the subject, the problem facing society today is that half the population is wary of order and morality, while the other half is suspicious of liberty, which is equated with permissiveness. In an in-depth analysis that masterfully cuts this Gordian knot, the author lays out how we can, indeed must, have both order and autonomy if we are to create a society in which communities and individuals can thrive. Recognizing that excessive morality and excessive liberty are each a dire threat to the health of society, Etzioni demonstrates how we have overreacted in recent years by assuming that there must be a tradeoff between morality and freedom. However, this need not be the case, because when order is largely based on moral commitments rather than on the law, and autonomy is regarded as a place in a social space, these two social virtues can reinforce each other.Using this framework, Etzioni studies the implications for the future of diversity in America, the implications for educating the next generation, and our relationships with other societies. He also explores the public policy implications of his observations and how governments, community groups and families can respond and grow.</p><p><b>Amitai Etzioni</b> is a University Professor at George Washington University and the author of fourteen books on social policy and ethics, including <i>The Spirit of Community</i> and <i>The Moral Dimension</i>. He is the founding president of the Communitarian Network, the editor of <i>The Responsive Community</i>, and a former president of the American Sociological Association. He lives in Washington, D.C.This chapter of sociologist Etzioni's (George Washington Univ.) ongoing communitarian campaign breaks new ground but ends up mired in intellectual bickering. Proponents of individual freedom find the communitarian emphasis on shared social values dangerously close to authoritarianism. Etzioni's current response to this fear is a reformulation of the golden rule: ``Respect and uphold society's moral order as you would have society respect and uphold your autonomy.'' For Etzioni (The Spirit of Community, 1993, etc.), following this rule in any society requires maintaining a balance between individual freedom and social imperatives, with the content of political action at any given time or place determined by whether the society has moved too far in either direction. There is much common sense here, and a laudable intention to develop principles that can be applied in the real world. Unfortunately, more effort goes into rebutting critics and splitting hairs with other communitarians than into sustained consideration of substantive issues. Etzioni's interest in extending arguments within the continuing intellectual debate is understandable, but for anyone not directly involved in the discussion, other concerns are more important. His use of the golden rule when prescribing policy for the US, for example, suffers from the unwarranted assumption that applying his principle is a relatively straightforward matter. Even if everyone were to accept balancing individual and social concerns as the appropriate goal, assessments of current conditions and the measures required to stabilize the scales are hardly uncontroversial judgments that follow easily from the premise. Etzioni's seemingly endless effort to find the middle ground leaves him with something more akin to Aristotle's golden mean than a rule, golden or otherwise, and more substantive work is needed to defend specific proposals. A thought-provoking work that needed to be more thoughtful to achieve its full potential. -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

This lively collection of traditional Christmas tales from around the world answers these questions with stories from five different cultures.

By the creators of George Washington: A Picture Book Biography.</p><p>Following the format of his picture-book biographies of George Washington (1992) and Thomas Jefferson (1994), Giblin, ably aided by artist Michael Dooling, presents the life of Benjamin Franklin--and an amazing life it was. Apprenticed to his brother as a printer, Franklin was soon running his own business and writing his own books, including the popular <i>Poor Richard's Almanack</i>. When Franklin became wealthy enough to retire, his life was just beginning. He indulged himself in his passion for science, worked for public improvements, such as libraries and hospitals, and, of course, became one of the nation's founding fathers as he tirelessly devoting himself to the affairs of a fledgling nation. Giblin's writing is lively, and he wisely uses the story of Franklin's estrangement from his only living son, a Royalist, to heighten dramatic tension. Dooling provides both expertly executed paintings and simple line drawings to bring Franklin's story close to today's readers. An especially useful touch is the wealth of back matter. Besides the expected time line and narrative bibliography, there is a page about Franklin's inventions, another with sayings from <i>Poor Richard's Almanack</i>, a list of historic sites associated with Franklin, and an informative illustrator's note. More than enough material for report writers but an intriguing offering for biography lovers as well. <i>Ilene Cooper</i>Grade 3-6-In a concise, readable style, this biography presents a great deal of information about a key figure in American history. Like Jean Fritz's What's the Big Idea, Ben Franklin? (Putnam, 1976), the book does not romanticize or sentimentalize Franklin's genius or his contributions. Giblin includes the challenges Franklin faced in establishing himself in business, his falling out with his son when they took different sides in the Revolutionary War, and the illnesses he suffered throughout his later years, and balances them with the man's successes in publishing, his inventions, and his diplomatic service. Dooling's realistic full-color, full-page paintings and spot sketches capture not only Franklin, his family, and colleagues, but also reveal much about life in the Colonies and England during this period. Concluding informational pages include a chronology of Franklin's life, a discussion of his inventions, a page of sayings from Poor Richard's Almanack, descriptions of historical sites associated with Franklin, and notes on sources used by both the biographer and the illustrator. These additions enrich and expand on the text. A balanced biography that belongs in all collections.<br><i>Barbara Chatton, College of Education, University of Wyoming, Laramie </i><br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Secret of Shark Reef</h2><p>The Three Investigators uncover evidence long buried on Shark Reef, exposing both a villain and his bizarre secret</p><p></p><h2>Charlotte Perriand: A Life of Creation</h2><p>In 1927, the French designer Charlotte Perriand -- then only twenty-four years old -- won instant acclaim for her design for the "Bar sous le toit" (bar in the garret), shown at the Salon d'Automne in Paris. The project brought her to the attention of Le Corbusier and Pierre Jeanneret, who asked Perriand to join their atelier. There she was put in charge of the furniture and fittings program and worked on such legendary designs as the sculptural <i>chaise longue</i>, the <i>grand confort </i>chair, and the <i>fauteuil ? dossier basculant</i> (sling chair).<br><br> Well known for her fundamental contribution to modern design, Perriand's adventurous life is somewhat more of an enigma. Her autobiography, <i>Charlotte Perriand: A Life of Creation</i> -- published in France in 1998 -- is the first major English-language volume on her career and personal history. Immediate and matter of fact, the text echoes Perriand's own direct character; the dozens of black-and-white photographs are for the most part drawn from her own archive.<br><br> In addition to her association with Le Corbusier, Perriand recounts her experiences in Russia, the Far East, and South America; she also discusses the projects she worked on after leaving Le Corbusier's atelier in 1937, ranging from a vast ski resort at Les Arcs to the "espace th�" (tea area) in the UNESCO garden in Paris. Her friendships with the great artists of the period, such as Fernand L�ger, offer valuable insight into the artistic scene of the time. Perriand's fascinating memoir is unique not only in its firsthand depiction of the goals and tenets of the heroic period of modern architecture but also in its portrayal of a century of life in Paris.</p><p>Charlotte Perriand was born in Paris in 1903. She worked as an architect and designer, both on her own and in collaboration with many leading architects of the modern movement, including Le Corbusier, Pierre Jeanneret, Jean Prouv�, and Paul Nelson. Perriand died in 1999.</p><h2>Acne RX</h2><p>"ACNE RX" the newest book by the definitive expert on acne, Dr. James E Fulton MD Ph.D.. Dr. Fulton is the co-developer of Retin A � and developer of Benzoyl Peroxide for the treatment of acne. <p>"ACNE RX" Finally, an effective treatment for clearing acne that works. Dr.Fulton's research has resulted in a treatment, which is so simple, so effective that no one ever again need accept and live with acne or endure the physical and emotional scars it leaves. </p><p>Once you understand what acne is you'll be taught other factors that will influence the treatment schedule most suitable to your acne condition. </p><p>You'll also learn the startling effect the seasons, sunlight, geography and the calendar have on acne; how stress and hormones can aggravate acne; what can be done about removing the physical scars acne causes and also how to deal with the psychological scars. </p><p>James E Fulton, Jr.M.D. Ph.D. is the co developer of Retin A� and the developer of Benzoyl Peroxide. Dr. Fulton continually pioneers new developments in skin care and has been an impiration in bringing new methods and standards to physicians worldwide.</p></p><p>Writing this book has brought me a peculiar mixture of both anguish and joy. The message is basic. While acne is a complicated, mysterious and devious disease, the treatment is remarkably simple and control is finally possible. That is the joy. The anguish lies in the personal memories I dislodged as I wrote. I traveled long journeys to come to the end of my acne. The medical establishment miserably failed me in my search for a treatment that would work. It is out of those failures that this book rises. <p>My severe cystic acne, which began in childhood and continued unabated into my twenties, was the impetus which led me into a career as a dermatologist and biochemist specializing in the research and treatment of acne. My professional obsession has been to discover methods which though too late for me personally, would save others from the scars of acne. Good Luck with your program.</p>Dr. Fulton graduted from Tulane University Medical School in 1965, received a Ph.D. in Biochemistry from the University of Miami in 1972 and is a fellow of both the American Academy of Cosmetic Surgery and American Academy of Dermatology. He is board certified in both specialties. <p>He is constantly on the leading edge of new breakthroughs in product development. He developed tretinion (Retin A�) with Dr. Albert Kligman for the University of Pennsylvania in 1969, benzoyl peroxide gel (Panoxyl�) and topical erthromycin(E-Gel�) with Dr. Harvey Blank for the University of Miami in 1975. His latest advancement in skin care therapeutics is the topical use of vitamin A propionate -US patent 5,043,356. </p><p>Dr. Fulton's achievements extend into the area of ocrrective chemical peels and facial laser abrasion for skin rejuvenation and the improvement of acne scars. He is a pioneer in dermatological cosmetic surgery techniques and has published more than 100 medical articles.</p></p><h2>Cruden&#39;s Complete Concordance</h2><p><p>For over 250 years, Cruden's Complete Concordance has been a standard tool for serious study of the Bible -- This edition offers you the most accurate, comprehensive, and readable rendering of Alexander Cruden's masterwork.

The books teach reading, but they also teach about poetry, politics, ethics, comics, history, and even conartistry! Complete with the text of both books, photographs, draft material, and essays by Seuss, <i>The Annotated Cat </i>is like a DVD with all the extras. Cat lovers everywhere can gain a deeper understanding of two of the most popular children's books ever written, and the remarkable man behind them.</p><p>Philip Nel is associate professor of English at Kansas State University. He is the author of <i>Dr. Seuss: American Icon </i>(2004), <i>The Avant-Garde and American Postmodernity: Small Incisive Shocks </i>(2002), and <i>J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter Novels: A Reader's Guide </i>(2001). At present, he is writing a biography of Crockett Johnson and Ruth Krauss and, with Julia Mickenberg, co-editing a collection of radical children's literature. He lives in Kansas.Why annotate a book that is under 4,000 words, even if it is celebrating its fiftieth anniversary? For one thing, <i>The Cat in the Hat </i>revolutionized the way kids learn to read. This lavishly illustrated and loving look at Dr. Seuss' small classic, as well as its sequel, <i>The Cat in the Hat Comes Back</i>, wins kudos for its introduction. Nel does a terrific job of supplying the backstory behind both the book and the man and explaining why and how <i>Cat </i>became a worldwide favorite. As for the annotations, they range from interesting to odd to, well, stretches. For instance, a riff about how Geisel identified with the Cat's "subversive sense of humor, and drew himself as both Cat and the Grinch" is captivating. The information that the parents in the original and the sequel have separate bedrooms might make one say, "Really?" But sometimes the annotations are merely a rephrasing of the text. More often the visuals are the real stars here, with beautiful reproductions of the original art juxtaposed against Geisel's earlier work. Seuss lovers will love the whole package.

Exposed to a plague of enemy sorcery that felled many of his compatriots, he prevailed, but at a terrible cost to his soul, body, and heart. Now he stands wrongly accused of unspeakable crimes&#x2014;including murder, the most heinous of them all. </p> <p> Condemned by his brother soldiers and sentenced to death, Nevare has no option but to escape. Suddenly he is an outcast and a fugitive&#x2014;a hostage to the Speck magic that shackles him to a savage alter ego who would destroy everything Nevare holds dear. With nowhere to turn&#x2014;except, perhaps, to the Speck woman Lisana, the enemy whom he loves&#x2014;he is mired in soul-rending despair. But from out of the darkness comes a bright spark of hope. </p> <p> Perhaps, somehow, the hated magic that has long abused Nevare can be used <i>by</i> him instead. Could he not learn to wield this mighty weapon for his own purposes rather than be enslaved by it? But down what perilous road will this desperate new quest lead him? And what will be the outcome and the ultimate new incarnation of Nevare Burvelle? </p></p><p><p> Robin Hobb is the author of the Farseer, Liveship Traders, and Tawny Man trilogies. She has also written as Megan Lindholm. She currently resides in Tacoma, Washington. </p>*Starred Review* Young soldier Nevare Burvelle&#x2019;s career and life seem to be drawing to a close, for he has been sentenced to death for crimes allegedly committed under the influence of Speck magic. Desperate, he flees into the wilderness and close to Speck territory, where the Speck curse turns him into a renegade against his own people. He uses all his skill and his previous experience to devise a plan to slaughter his old comrades wholesale and return to the Speck the territory they claim. Yet he doesn&#x2019;t lose his memories of other loyalties and friendships, and in the last two-thirds of the book, a terrifying ethical conflict takes place within him as he battles to resist the very real temptation to become an all-destroying demonic force. Hobb has a positive genius for using fantasy themes to set up ethical conflicts, exhibited to great advantage in the Liveship Traders (Ship of Magic, 1998; Mad Ship, 1999; Ship of Destiny, 2000) and with equal or greater power here in Soldier Son (Shaman&#x2019;s Crossing,&nbsp; 2005; Forest Mage, 2006; Renegade&#x2019;s Magic). There are no easy victories, no all-conquering forces on either side in Hobb&#x2019;s work, and both sides are sufficiently well characterized in their vivid settings that there are very few straw men in evidence. Absolutely essential for high-fantasy collections. --Roland Green</p><h2>The Dark Beyond the Stars: A Novel</h2><p>After two thousand years of searching the galaxy for alien life forms, the starship Astron has begun to fall apart, but before it does, it will explore across the Dark, a one-hundred generation journey through empty space.

He blends Eastern models of death and rebirth with a more Western emphasis on personal identity and the soul of the individual, offering a comprehensive &#x201c;map&#x201d; of the afterlife.<br><br>&nbsp;Writing in a clear and approachable tone, Tompkins proves himself to be just an average person trying to make sense of something that we all will face. With the advances of modern medicine enabling us to live longer, we have become increasingly distanced from death, and thus more fearful of the inevitable. Tompkins, however, argues that our experiences of growth and change do not stop at the moment of death, but in many ways only begin there.<br><br>&nbsp;Like its ancient predecessors, <i>The Modern Book of the Dead</i> frames death not as an end but as a beginning, yet it also embraces science and demonstrates how the older books can be brought into line with twenty-first century perspectives.

But when I was a kid, I <i>really</i> didn&#x2019;t like it. That each day should have to come to an end with the closing of the door of my room and the (usually) all too long wait for unconsciousness to arrive seemed not only unfair; it seemed downright absurd. The darkness and separation that night brought with it filled me with a pure childish anxiety that I can still conjure up today.<br> <br>It was while lying in bed as a young child and waiting for sleep to come that I remember doing my earliest significant thinking about death. One night, at about age five, I awoke in a cold sweat from a dream in which the people I knew had appeared as one-dimensional paper cutouts. My father, my mother, my teachers&#x2014;everyone was reduced, in the dream, to these simple paper shapes, each wearing a single, static expression, some smiling, some frowning, but all equally shallow, all equally empty of true human presence.<br> <br>In its simple, straightforward way, this dream summed up all the deepest anxieties I had about life as a kid. The notion that the human world was really just a surface event with nothing real beneath it, that the people I knew and the world I lived in had, in fact, no true or lasting substance... Wasn&#x2019;t that what the concept of death&#x2014;impossibly remote and hard to understand, yet at the same time hugely, intimately close and ever-present&#x2014;really suggested?<br> <br>The more I thought about death as a kid, the more strange it seemed to me that most people in the world around me had so little to say about it&#x2014;or at least, so little of any real usefulness. In 1970, when I was eight, my mother read E. B. White&#x2019;s children&#x2019;s book <i>Charlotte&#x2019;s Web</i> aloud to me. At the end of the book, when Charlotte the spider died, I struggled to get my head around the idea that Wilbur the pig could have gotten any happiness or consolation from the fact that Charlotte had left a nest of baby spiders behind to keep him company. Babies or no babies, Charlotte was still gone. Wasn&#x2019;t that what really counted?<br> <br>That same year, I began suffering a new series of nightmares turning around the theme of being kidnapped. In most of these scenarios, a group of malevolent but otherwise unidentifiable men crept up on me while I was sleeping, stuffed me into a sack, and dragged me away to a cabin in the middle of a dark forest.<br> <br>In an effort to find out what lay at the root of these fantasies, my father enlisted the help of a Scientologist friend of his named Rebecca. For several months in the spring of that year, I made regular visits to a small office in downtown Washington, DC, where Rebecca hooked me up to an E-meter&#x2014;a lie-detector-like device that Scientologists use to measure electrical fluctuations at the surface of the skin. Over the course of half a dozen of these visits, Rebecca attempted, through a series of questions and a close study of the E-meter&#x2019;s reactions to my answers, to lead me back to my previous lifetimes on earth. For, my father maintained, it was during one of those lifetimes that the event or events that were secretly causing my kidnapping anxieties had actually occurred.<br> <br>A writer who specialized in occult and esoteric subjects (1971&#x2019;s <i>Secrets of the Great Pyramid</i> and 1973&#x2019;s <i>The Secret Life of Plants</i> are, today, his chief enduring claims to fame), my father wasn&#x2019;t a card-carrying Scientologist. But he <i>was</i> a great believer in the idea&#x2014;common to Scientology, Theosophy, Anthroposophy, and many of the other new or semi-new spiritual movements that seized so many people&#x2019;s attention in the sixties and seventies&#x2014;that the human soul preexisted the body, and will outlive it as well. My father revered the great early architects of new age thought. People like Helena Blavatsky (the controversial Russian mystic and founder of Theosophy), Rudolf Steiner (the Austrian philosopher and educator and founder of Anthroposophy), Edgar Cayce (the American clairvoyant famous for predictions he made while in a state of trance), and Scientology&#x2019;s founder, L. Ron Hubbard, came up on a daily basis in our household. Different though the teachings of these thinkers were in certain of their specifics, my father believed that they had all made important contributions to a new way of looking at human beings and their place in the universe: a way that was, he felt, going to have a growing influence on the hopelessly confining antispiritual view of the world that more and more people in the West had been abiding by ever since the scientific revolution had occurred three hundred years earlier.<br> <br>Like many early enthusiasts of what was just then starting to be called new age thought, my father was strongly suspicious of conventional science, believing that most scientists spent most of their time covering up the real truth about the world rather than revealing it. He distrusted the proponents of traditional religious faith&#x2014;most especially Christianity&#x2014;even more, and never missed an opportunity to warn me against believing what the more conventional voices of wisdom in the world I lived in (teachers, school friends&#x2019; parents, people on TV) had to say about the way things really worked. To my father&#x2019;s way of thinking, conventional science and conventional faith were both roadblocks to experiencing who and what each of us really is: a free spirit living in a cosmos that is not purely material, but material <i>and</i> spiritual: a cosmos that humankind was on the verge of seeing and experiencing in a new and infinitely larger way.<br> <br>At the center of this new picture of the universe was a vision of the human being as an essentially spiritual entity: a being that had taken on a physical body as part of a process of growth, or evolution, that had begun far in the past and would continue far into the future. That humans were more than their present physical bodies wasn&#x2019;t simply interesting news to my father, it was revolutionary news. For when one took this view, human life was transformed in a moment from the painful, puzzling, and generally pointless exercise it so often seemed to be into a <i>story that is going somewhere.</i> When you held to the kind of worldview that my father and his new age friends did, at no single moment, no matter how futile and pointless life might seem, was it ever really so. Even on the bleakest days and in the lowest of circumstances, one need never feel totally lost or totally without hope. Instead, even at those points when life seemed to make least sense, one was simply like a football player so disoriented in the confusion of a scrimmage that he has momentarily lost sight of the end zone.<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re not bodies,&#x201d; my father liked to say, summing up this entire new view of life and the human place within it: &#x201c;we <i>have</i> bodies.&#x201d;<br> <br>My father (correctly, I would later discover) pointed out that the basic notion of reincarnation&#x2014;that is, that we are souls, not bodies, and that as such we have each inhabited more than one of the latter over the course of time&#x2014;had been the norm rather than the exception for most of human history. It was still an accepted reality for the cultures of the Far East, and even the more mystical elements of Judaism and Islam continued to make room for it as well. When you got down to it, it was really only Christianity&#x2014;that most ideologically thorny of all the world religions&#x2014;that had said a definite &#x201c;no&#x201d; to the possibility that we are born more than once upon the earth.<br> <br>And yet it was possible&#x2014;indeed, said my father, even probable&#x2014;that in their earliest days even Christians had embraced this doctrine as well. Jesus himself, said my father, knew that we move from body to body, taking birth time and again. But for various reasons, the early Church fathers had proclaimed the doctrine of rebirth a heresy, thus removing from Christianity one of the most genuinely useful tools to help us earthbound humans make sense of how and why we had ended up getting (momentarily) trapped in the web of material existence to begin with. Instead of spiritual evolution, instead of a cosmos where people dropped into and came out of earthly incarnation like a line of butterfly-stroking swimmers gracefully plunging into and surging out of the water as they moved down the length of an Olympic-size swimming pool, Christians believed that each of us had come to birth once and only once, created out of nothing at conception and consigned, after a single, short, and (usually) all too painful and confusing life, either to a choking, smoke-filled hell, or to an almost equally undesirable heaven full of clouds, halos, and not much else; a heaven where bad people weren&#x2019;t allowed and where good people went for all eternity&#x2014;to do what, exactly, it was hard to say.<br> <br>I had actually been named for one of those early, reincarnation-espousing Christians. Though people tend to assume that my namesake is the ancient Greco-Roman astronomer famous for proclaiming earth the center of the universe, my father always gave a mildly derisive laugh when people suggested this. In fact, I got my name from Ptolemy the Gnostic, an obscure metaphysical philosopher whom my father happened to have been lying in bed reading about when my mother went into labor next to him in early May 1962. &#x201c;Here comes Ptolemy!&#x201d; my father had said cheerfully and decisively, shutting the book and reaching for his car keys.<br> <br>Not that my father thought my mother was necessarily giving birth to that one and the same Ptolemy he was reading about in his book. But my father would have been the first to point out that she certainly <i>might</i> have been. For like many advocates of the theory of reincarnation, he believed that we choose our parents each time we leave the light-shot realms of spirit behind and sink back to earth for another go-round. So whoever this new player entering the game board of his personal life was&#x2014;whichever particular soul had tired of the freedoms of the spirit world and opted for another temporary dive back down into the bracing murk of physical existence&#x2014;he knew it was someone who, for better or worse, had made the conscious choice to do so as his son.<br> <br>One might think that having a father with such a positive spiritual philosophy would have prevented me from suffering the kind of anxieties about death and darkness that plagued me so consistently through my childhood. But rather than curing me of my fears about death, my father&#x2019;s philosophy actually put them into sharper focus. For the fact was that though my father talked a good game in the spiritual department, the actual details of his life often fell far short of the ideals he painted so glowingly in his conversation. He and my mother fought a good deal, and the fights did not lessen in number when, in that same year of 1970, my father brought his new mistress, a woman named Betty, to live in our house along with my mother and father and me. The social and sexual experimentation that the late sixties and early seventies are remembered for today took an especially heavy toll on our household, and while peace and love and harmony were the ostensible goals of that experimentation, in our house they tended to produce very different results.<br> <br>Why bother going into all this personal stuff in a book that&#x2019;s supposed to be on the afterlife, not my personal life? The short and simple answer is that I believe the details of my upbringing are strangely well suited as a vehicle for introducing certain key questions about the afterlife and how we go about understanding it today. One of the main reasons I&#x2019;m interested in the afterlife&#x2014;and it has been my central interest for all of my adult life&#x2014;is that the world I grew up in <i>taught</i> me to be interested in it.<br> <br>When I say &#x201c;the world,&#x201d; what I am really saying, I suppose, is: my father. Whether he meant to or not, my father doomed me, in a way, to be taken up with the subject of where we were before we were born and what becomes of us afterward, and the details of my life with him provide a kind of synopsis of how our culture got to where it is in terms of its relationship to the world that might or might not lie in wait beyond the body.<br> <br>My father loved movies, and taking me to them was his primary means of educating me. Whatever film we ended up seeing&#x2014;usually at one of the Washington, DC, theaters across the river from our (at that time still quite rural) Northern Virginia house&#x2014;he almost always had something significant to say about it on the drive home: something that put whatever action we had seen on the screen within a larger&#x2014;usually cosmically large&#x2014;context.<br> <br>Many of the movies we went to see together were fairly adult in nature. In 1972, when I was ten, my father took me to a British film called <i>Tales from the Crypt.</i> Based on the &#x2019;50s EC comic book of the same name, it was, like the comic, broken up into several segments, each one featuring a story based on a tale originally published in the magazine.<br> <br>The film begins with the protagonists of the different episodes all gathering together, apparently by happenstance, in an underground crypt. A groundskeeper singles out each character and tells their story&#x2014;seemingly as if it hasn&#x2019;t happened yet.<br> <br>At the end of the film, it is revealed that the characters are in fact all already dead, and that the crypt they have found themselves in is the first section of the underworld, where each has been sent as payment for the bad&#x2014;the <i>very</i> bad&#x2014;actions they committed while alive.<br> <br>In the first story segment, Joan Collins plays a woman at home with her husband and daughter, a girl of about eight, on Christmas Eve. While the daughter lies in bed upstairs awaiting Santa, Joan sneaks up on her husband from behind and bashes him in the head with a poker from the fireplace. She then cleans up the mess and stows the body in the basement. As she is finishing up with this, the Christmas carols on the radio are interrupted by an announcement that a homicidal maniac has escaped from a nearby asylum. Everyone in the area, the radio says, should be on the alert for a six-foot-three man with dark eyes, weighing 210 pounds.<br> <br>Joan locks the door and gets back to what she was doing. Moments later, a very sinister outside shot shows a giant Santa walking through the snow up to the door, a little Christmas bell in hand. He bangs on the door and then peers through the window&#x2014;eyes bugging, Santa hat askew. Joan hides on the floor just under the window. Does he see her? It&#x2019;s uncertain, but somehow we sense that Santa knows Joan is in there: that he has, in fact, come precisely for her.<br> <br>Will Santa get Joan before she can clean up the evidence of the murder and call the police? More perplexingly, do we even care if he does? For perhaps, given how awful a person she clearly is, we might actually <i>want</i> Joan to get a comeuppance of some kind. Perhaps even one as bad as perishing at the hands of the psychotic Santa.<br> <br>These questions play in the viewer&#x2019;s head as Joan continues to get rid of the last of the evidence. Just as we think Joan might have things completely under control, her daughter&#x2014;who by this time we had assumed was asleep&#x2014;calls out from the living room.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mummy, Mummy! It&#x2019;s Santa! I let him in.&#x201d;<br> <br>...</p><h2>What&#39;s in the Midwest?

It is a treasure house of facts concerning the early history of Okinawan karate, descriptions of the early training and, best of all, it describes Chojun Miyagi&#x2019;s ethical ideals, teaching methods and way of life, providing a valuable source of knowledge and understanding to guide the present day karateka. </p><p>This book should be on the shelf of every serious student of karate, and it should be read often.</p></p><p>Morio Higaonna was born on December 25, 1938 in Naha, Okinawa and grew up just around the corner from the house of the famous Chojun Miyagi. He began his karate training in 1953, at the age of 14, under the tutelage of his father, a Shorin Ryu stylist. At the age of 15 he began training with a friend, Tsunetaka Shimabukuro, another Shorin Ryu stylist. In 1955 Shimabukuro, who also trained Goju-Ryu at the garden dojo of Chojun Miyagi, encouraged the young Higaonna to study this powerful style and, with an introduction to the garden dojo, Higaonna was accepted as a student. He relates, &#x201c;When I first joined I remember thinking that An'ichi Miyagi was the head of the garden dojo since he was the one who did all the teaching. This impression was furthered by Koshin Iha, who was in charge of collecting the training fees. I'll never forget him pointing to An&#x2019;ichi Sensei and saying, &#x2018;An&#x2019;ichi-san is the most knowledgeable person here. Go and learn from him&#x2019;&#x201d;. <p>Chojun Sensei&#x2019;s widow, Makato, was still living at this time. Usually the first to arrive, Higaonna would do various chores to get the area ready for the evening&#x2019;s practice. He would finish these chores well before the other students would arrive and Makato would sometimes call him over to chat. Of all the things they spoke about, Higaonna vividly remembers two things Mrs. Miyagi told him: 1)For those who practice martial arts, smoking is the worst thing for the body, so you must never smoke; and 2)You should learn from An&#x2019;ichi Miyagi. Higaonna took her words to heart in both cases. </p><p>Higaonna also taught karate at his high school karate club, completely filling his days with his passion. </p><p>In 1960 Higaonna moved to Tokyo to attend Takushoku University. His passion for karate continued to drive him and during his free time he would visit various dojos around the Tokyo area. One dojo owner (Aragaki) in the Yoyogi district of Tokyo invited Higaonna to teach there, even though it was a Shorin Ryu dojo. It wasn&#x2019;t long before Yoyogi Dojo converted to Goju-Ryu. Higaonna's reputation and popularity grew, reaching to the four corners of the globe. Within a few years he had developed such a large following that the need for a formal organization became apparent. At the urging of his followers, and with the support of many of Chojun Miyagi's senior students, in 1979 Higaonna formed the International Okinawan Goju-Ryu Karate-Do Federation (IOGKF) with the purpose to preserve, protect and disseminate the true teachings of Chojun Miyagi and Okinawan Goju-Ryu. </p><p>The Technical Headquarters for the IOGKF is in Okinawa at the HIGAONNA DOJO, where Sensei Higaonna teaches. However, with tens of thousands of members worldwide, Sensei Higaonna travels extensively throughout each year teaching seminars and gasshukus (karate camps). Even with his hectic schedule, he himself trains several hours every day, for he feels that one should never cease learning and expanding one&#x2019;s own knowledge &#x2014; and he encourages his instructors to do the same. </p><p>In addition to teaching and conducting seminars throughout the world, Sensei Higaonna has produced scores of technical books and videos to aid serious students in their training and development. </p><p>In 1997 the acclaimed Nihon Kobudo Kyokai, whose primary mission is to protect and preserve traditional martial arts, inducted Morio Higaonna into their ranks and recognized him as the SOLE representative for Okinawan Goju-Ryu karate in the world. </p><p>Sensei Higaonna continues to devote his life to the research, training and the dissemination of Okinawan Goju-Ryu.</p>"A treasure... of facts concerning the early history of... karate, it contains wonderful descriptions of the early training in Okinawa." -- <i>Journal of Asian Martial Arts, November 1999</i><br><br>"The History of Karate" is considered the definitive work on the subject!" -- <i>Dragon Times, Vol. 19</i><br><br>"This book is the closest thing available in English to the primary source for the early period of Okinawan karate." -- <i>Journal of Asian Martial Arts, November 1999</i></p><h2>Treasures in Heaven and Other Stories Jesus Told (I Can Read God&#39;s Word)</h2><p>Bright, bold pictures illustrate the powerful parables of Christ, which are carefully paraphrased for beginning readers by the award-winning author and illustrator.

Tour.</p><p>Bestselling author Jane Bryant Quinn has revised and updated her classic 1991 primer on finance, <i>Making the Most of Your Money</i>, to prepare readers for the challenging fiscal atmosphere that she sees in the coming century. Written in her familiar, easily understood style, it starts out by helping you determine exactly where you stand on money matters and explaining basic money management techniques. Next, Quinn offers comprehensive discussions about insurance needs, home ownership, college funding, investment planning, and retirement. A useful series of appendices provides additional information on insurance, college, bonds, pensions, and more.<p>This classic book of solid and practical financial advice has been completely refocused to address new tax laws, new ways of paying for higher education, new forms of health insurance, and the completely new investment climate. </p><p>As a financial planning tool, the original <i>Making the Most of Your Money</i> predicted a change in America's priorities&#x2014;away from an obsession with spending and toward a desire to save and invest. The book also foresaw an environment dominated by falling inflation and interest rates. That call was right on the money. </p><p>The new edition sees yet another shift in financial energies -- a fresh round of serious borrowing, as the boomers start sending kids to college; a desire to save for retirement fast; and an obsession with keeping safe the profits that have already been made. Investing is getting more complex, as more financial products and services come to market and as traditional guideposts change. More than ever, investors need a clear path through the undergrowth. </p><p>The new <i>Making the Most of Your Money</i> is that path. It presents a new blueprint for twenty-first-century success. </p><p><i>On investing:</i> The markets will surprise you. Serious investors need a better understanding of asset allocation and how to diversify for global gains while minimizing risk. The new edition presents a variety of investment mixes for different purposes. You'll also find a sophisticated guide to picking superior mutual funds. </p><p><i>On paying for college:</i> The entire federal financial-aid program has been overhauled. Much more money is available to middle-class families, making paying for college the art of the possible. This book takes you through all the money sources. </p><p><i>On buying a home:</i> The percentage of Americans owning their own homes is on an upswing. That's because mortgage lenders are rapidly opening their doors to people who couldn't get loans before. They also have the welcome mat out for young first-time buyers. You'll find out here how all these new programs work. </p><p><i>On life and health insurance:</i> Life insurance and tax-deferred annuities are being widely sold as retirement investments. The new edition helps you decide when that's a good idea and when it isn't (hint: it usually isn't). In a greatly expanded section on HMOs, Quinn explains how to evaluate the choices you have and lays out your rights if your insurer lets you down. </p><p><i>On retirement planning:</i> Employees have built up significant assets in 401(k)s and other tax-deferred plans. The self-employed have several deductible options to choose from -- each one just right for a particular situation. An expanded retirement section helps you get the most from any retirement savings plan and forecasts how much you're likely to need in your old age. </p><p><i>On post retirement planning:</i> Given longer life spans, people who think they've retired haven't. A section for those past retirement lays out better investment strategies for making money last. </p><p><i>On the checklists for changes in your life:</i> The checklist chapter-one of the sections of the original edition that was consulted most often&#x2039;has been expanded to include checklists for starting a home based business, teaching kids about money, unmarried couples, new widows and widowers, and defensive planning for a potential layoff. Quinn has also added to the existing checklists on pre- and post-marital planning, caring for an elderly parent, having a baby, finding day care, and enduring divorce. </p><p><i>On finding a financial adviser:</i> Almost every financial salesperson today claims to be a financial planner -- so you'll learn more about how to separate the mutts from the purebreds. But with what you learn here you can be your own financial adviser. No one will ever care as much about your money as you do. </p><p> The completely revised and updated <i>Making the Most of Your Money</i> will carry Americans through the millennium-pointing younger workers toward saving the rising incomes they're going to earn, boomers toward the retirement that can be more successful than they think, and retirees toward an investment plan they can be comfortable with. With this edition, you'll be making the most of your money ever.</p></p><h2>Susanna Foo Fresh Inspiration: New Approaches to Chinese Cuisine</h2><p>The James Beard Award-winning chef details her new take on Chinese cuisine, redefining Chinese cookery with the use of fresh ingredients and readily available items in more than 150 recipes that include Ten-Vegetable Hot-and-Sour Soup, Braised Salmon with Soy and Ginger, Corn Cakes with Cilantro and Chives, and Coconut Panna Cotta.</p><p>Susanna Foo is the chef-owner of Susanna Foo Chinese Cuisine in Phildelphia and Suilan by Susanna Foo in Atlantic City.Fusion has earned a bad reputation, mostly due to silly combinations that, while intellectually interesting, are often just not that appetizing. Foo (chef/owner of two restaurants and a two-time James Beard Award winner) keeps things lively yet appealing by not going too wacky. Yes, Panko-Crusted Goat Cheese with Tomato and Asparagus Salad uses Japanese bread crumbs, but Alice Waters has been making goat cheese crunchy for years. Likewise, Grilled Lamb Chops with Roasted Sesame Marinade replaces the lamb tenderloin more commonly used in Mongolian shish kabob with a different cut, but preserves the classic flavors. Sometimes Asian ingredients shake hands with Western techniques, as in a savory Rice Noodle Flan and Asian Pear Tatin. There are more traditional dishes, too, like Braised Red Snapper with Thai Curry Sauce and Braised Lion's Head Meatballs "the size of a fist." Foo shares encyclopedic knowledge about everything from long beans (which are part of the black-eyed pea family) to braising (great for tenderizing cheaper cuts of meat). If there is a flaw, it may be that Foo is too wide-ranging, so that the selection occasionally feels unfocused. Overall, though, this is a thoughtful collection of fresh, elegant recipes.

It's a world where cows eat hy instead of hay and serpents and snakes become hiss-less erpents and nakes. Children will be amused by the nonsense words and intrigued by Diaz's bold computer-generated artwork. A 1999 Parents' Choice� Recommendation.

Drawing on cases he worked for the New Mexico Office of the Medical Investigator, Rhine demonstrates how unidentified skeletal remains indicate race, sex, age, height, and ultimately identity and how the specialist decodes skeletal anomalies to establish cause of death. Blunt trauma, gunshot and knife wounds, and other injuries receive his attention.</p><p>Step by step the author explains the techniques used to solve forensic mysteries. At the end of each case, he explains what lessons the forensic anthropologist learns from the bones.

They know the routine by now; they&#x2019;ve seen it enough times that they can predict what&#x2019;s going to happen. Each spring, as the April 15 tax deadline approaches, the number of incoming phone calls begins to increase, a little more each week, until they are double their usual volume. The branch offices become crowded with customers and potential customers, as people jostle each other to pore over the merchandise or angle for a quiet word with an overworked salesperson.<br> <br>For those in the business, spring has become a version of Christmas-time&#x2014;one of the most important selling seasons of the year.1 Except, of course, the merchandise they are offering isn&#x2019;t toys or clothes. It&#x2019;s equity mutual funds. It&#x2019;s certificates of deposit. It&#x2019;s annuities. It&#x2019;s municipal bond funds and individual stocks and overseas funds and hundreds of other tempting &#x201c;financial products&#x201d;&#x2014;to use another of those unfortunate but useful phrases that have entered the language. In the spring, the industry has come to understand, millions of Americans go shopping for an investment, searching for a place to invest $2,000 or so in an Individual Retirement Account. That&#x2019;s something we do now in America, pretty much as a matter of course: we shop for investments. Shopping for investments has become our habit and our responsibility, our burden and our thrill. It is an activity that has insinuated itself into the rhythms of middle-class life.<br> <br>Whenever a large behavioral change enters the realm of habit&#x2014;whenever it becomes akin to watching television or using a personal computer, something that was once new and strange but is now second nature&#x2014;we tend to forget where it came from, and what life was like before its arrival on the scene. This is so even when the change in question is relatively recent, as is the case here. This book is a history of one such enormous change in American life: the astonishing transformation of the financial habits of the middle class. By this I&#x2019;m referring not only to the process that led us to become investors, though that&#x2019;s certainly a large part of it. Rather, I&#x2019;m speaking about a broader set of habits that have resulted from Americans having to take charge of their own financial lives, habits that include changes in the way we borrow, the way we save, even the way we think about our money. Over the past two decades, we&#x2019;ve been participating in nothing less than a money revolution. This is not a term I use lightly. When one recalls what the financial life of the middle class was like twenty years ago&#x2014;when thrift was the highest virtue, when the daily movement of the Dow Jones average had almost no relevance to our lives, when few of us knew what a mutual fund was, much less the distinction between, say, a growth fund and a balanced fund&#x2014;it&#x2019;s hard not to conclude that this transformation has, indeed, been revolutionary.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s always difficult to pinpoint precisely where social revolutions spring from, and the money revolution is no exception. If you ask the marketers at the big mutual fund companies, they&#x2019;ll tell you that it is we who have instigated the changes, by grabbing control of our financial destiny and forcing the nation&#x2019;s financial institutions to cater to our yearnings. &#x201c;People want control,&#x201d; a marketer at Fidelity Investments told me several years ago. &#x201c;They want to make their own decisions.&#x201d; No doubt there is some truth in what the man says.<br> <br>But it&#x2019;s equally true, I think, that most of us perceive the money revolution as being fueled by &#x201c;them&#x201d;&#x2014;the nation&#x2019;s financial companies&#x2014;rather than by us. We feel pulled into it by forces larger than ourselves. We didn&#x2019;t demand, for example, the right to be able to make an instant personal loan by pulling a piece of plastic out of our pocket, to cite another financial innovation that helped instigate a huge behavioral change. Somebody, somewhere, had to create those things we now know as Visa and MasterCard, and then they had to persuade us to use them. And, in addition, the social and economic conditions had to be exactly right to cause this practice of paying by credit card to catch on&#x2014;to cause it, that is, to become one of our new financial habits. The history of the money revolution is a history of all those somebodies, somewhere&#x2014;the inventors of credit cards, the creators of discount brokerages, the marketers of mutual funds&#x2014;and a history of those larger forces, such as inflation and financial deregulation, that made such innovations all but inevitable, and a history of our own evolving attitudes, which caused us to embrace these innovations. It&#x2019;s pointless, it seems to me, to try to place one factor over all the others, and in the pages that follow, I&#x2019;ve tried not to do that. Had any one ingredient been missing, this stew would never have been made. Of that I&#x2019;m convinced.<br> <br>I&#x2019;m equally convinced, by the way, that the money revolution has been, in general, a force for good. Without question, it&#x2019;s created a layer of complication to our already complicated lives, adding responsibilities that didn&#x2019;t exist before, making it necessary for us to learn about things that never used to be among our concerns. We can make mistakes with our money now, and those mistakes can be costly. Markets, as we&#x2019;ve learned again and again in recent years, can go down as well as up. Taking control of our finances can be quite nerve-racking at times. But we also have tools and resources at our disposal that were formerly unavailable to us, and we have been handed possibilities for making money that had always been out of our reach. The financial markets were once the province of the wealthy, and they&#x2019;re not anymore; they belong to all of us. We&#x2019;ve finally gotten a piece of the action. If we have to pay attention now, if we have to come to grips with our own tolerance for risk, if we&#x2019;re forced to spend a little time learning about which financial instruments make sense for us and which ones don&#x2019;t, that seems to me an acceptable price to pay. Democracy always comes at some price. Even financial democracy.<br> <br>Sometimes change comes about in an obvious and dramatic way, but more often it takes place gradually and even imperceptibly. It&#x2019;s only afterward, when the dust has settled, that we suddenly have the presence of mind to look up and see that everything is different. The money revolution has been a work in progress for some thirty years now, but it&#x2019;s only been quite recently that we&#x2019;ve finally been able to look up and see how much has changed. When did we start putting our savings in money market funds instead of bank passbook accounts? When did we start using credit cards for items that used to require a trip to see the loan officer at the bank? When did mutual funds capture our fancy? When did we become so aware of yield that we began moving our money around to capture an extra half a percentage point? When did we start keeping track of the Japanese stock market? When did this all happen? How did this all happen?<br> <br>Here is how it happened.</p><h2>The Tale of Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle</h2><p>Glossy pictorial hardcover no dust jacket. 1985 59p. 5.60x4.25x0.40 CHILDREN BOOK ABOUT LITTLE GIRL- LUCIE AND TABBY KITTEN.</p><p>Beatrix Potter is one of the world&#39;s best-loved children&#39;s authors of all time.

Scourges that have plagued human beings since the ancients still threaten to unleash themselves; new maladies are brewing that have yet to make their appearance in the headlines; lethal germs employed as weapons of warfare and terrorism have reemerged as a worldwide menace. Regardless of their mode of attack, microbes exist to multiply, thrive, and find new hosts; they cross national boundaries and social classes, attacking without prejudice. <br><br>Now medical historian and pediatrician Howard Markel, author of Quarantine! (&#x201c;Engrossing . . . Meticulously documented&#x201d; &#x2014;Sherwin Nuland, <i>The New Republic)</i>, tells the story of six epidemics that broke out during the two great waves of immigration to the United States&#x2014;from 1880 through 1924, and from 1965 to the present&#x2014;and shows how federal legislation closed the gates to newcomers for almost forty-one years out of fear that these new people would alter the social, political, economic, and even genetic face of the nation. <br><br>Markel writes about tuberculosis today, the most serious public health threat facing the contemporary world. He writes about bubonic plague and how it came to this country in the early twentieth century; about trachoma in the years before World War I; about Ellis Island and how an East European rabbi was diagnosed and treated for the dreaded eye infection; about typhus fever and an epidemic on the Texas-Mexico border in the aftermath of Pancho Villa&#x2019;s revolution; and about AIDS, the Haitian exodus, and the early years of the AIDS epidemic.<br><br>Markel explains how immigration in the twenty-first century is characterized by porous borders, rapid travel, and scattered destinations. While more than 75 percent of all immigrants during the first great wave of immigration came through New York Harbor, transportation today allows travel to all parts of the United States from the farthest reaches of the globe, giving public health physicians little opportunity to definitively diagnose infectious diseases that can incubate silently in a traveler, making the spread of epidemics far more than a theoretical concern.<br><br>Markel looks at our nation&#x2019;s response to the pathogens present in our midst and examines our foolhardy attempts at isolation and our vacillation between demanding a public health system so punitive that it worsens matters rather than protects and settling for one that is too lax; how we are fascinated with all things infectious and then hardly give microbes a second thought; how the United States, a country that since its inception has prided itself on being a nation of immigrants, continues its tradition of blaming newcomers for its physical and social ills; and how globalization, social upheaval, and international travel render us all potential inhabitants of the so-called Hot Zone. Finally, Markel puts forth a plan for a globally funded public health program that could stop the spread of epidemics, help eradicate certain diseases, and protect us all.</p><p>Among the United States' proudest 20th-century scientific achievements was the identification and control of many dangerous infectious diseases. But as medical historian Howard Markel reveals in <i>When Germs Travel</i>, quarantines and other disease-control programs often hid racism, nationalism, and class warfare beneath a veneer of public health. This book focuses on six epidemics to demonstrate how social structures and science can clash--tuberculosis, bubonic plague, trachoma, typhus, cholera, and AIDS. What these diseases have in common is that they were perceived to have been brought to the United States by "outsiders," who found themselves unwelcome even in a nation of immigrants. <p> </p><blockquote>In the diaries and memoirs of immigrants arriving during the early twentieth century, one repeatedly encounters evidence of the intense fear of the physicians at Ellis Island, the medical inspection process, and the potential for deportation.</blockquote><p> In proving that radical responses such as quarantines are ineffective and not based on good science, Markel applies a personal perspective gained through his family's experiences as Eastern European immigrants as well as his own interactions with 21st century immigrant patients. The six epidemiological histories here are gripping, and Markel's style is reminiscent of Sherwin Nuland or Gina Kolata. Humanity is locked in an eternal war with microbes, Markel writes, and despite all efforts, "contagion cannot be confined to national borders." <i>--Therese Littleton</i></p>Howard Markel is the George E.

Unfortunately, most directed at the general public tend to cite only the four main groups: rattlers, corals, copperheads and water moccasins ("Cottonmouths"). There is wide variety within these divisions, and many non-venomous species superficially resemble some of the dangerous ones. The books that delve into much detail, particularly those with good color photos, tend to appeal more to professional scientists and serious amateur naturalists than they do to Joe and Susie Sixpack. (Maybe we'd better call them Charlie and Claire Hunter here...) <p>There has been a real need for a book easily used by hunters, campers, anglers, Scout leaders, and others who aren't interested enough to spend maybe $60 on a snake book, but who may need detailed photos and text to enable them to identify snakes encountered in the field. If such a book could also function as a really good field guide for the enthusiast, and sell for a modest price, the world would be a better place. </p><p>Well, the world just improved! Stoeger, famed for the Shooter's Bible gun annual, has just released US Guide to Venomous Snakes and their Mimics. How important is it? Considering that the broad category of rattlesnakes alone contains some 62 known species and over 80 subspecies, one can see that it is important to identify which one of them has bitten someone. This is especially crucial when similar looking species differ significantly in venom. </p><p>The color photos are clear and profuse, adding greatly to the ease of identifying the reptiles. The different geographic zones in which certain species are found are well defined, and the author admits that there is some overlap at the fringes. </p><p>US Guide to Venomous Snakes and their Mimics is a profound new work that will be of interest to outdoor enthusiasts of every kind, to doctors and wildlife professionals. -- <i>Jim Williamson, The New Gun Week, April 10, 2005</i><br><br>Shupe has spent much of his life "tracking" snakes to their varying lairs, and passes that information on to readers. -- <i>Glenn Ayers, NC Times News, August 14, 2005</i></p></p><h2>Green River (River Journal Series)</h2><p>This River Journal is one book in a continueing series highlighting the premier North American fly fishing rivers.

I'd hate to lose it."<br>"I--maybe no can," she said in her broken Norse.<br>Father grinned. "You can try. Don't you Finns have witch-sight?"<br>Already his mood was better. He had cuffed the thrall who forgetfully left the tool behind at sunset after having cleaned some fish down by the water. With kicks he had sent the wretch stumbling toward the byre, where bondsmen slept among cows. That cooled his wrath.<br>"I try," Seija muttered. She could ill say no, a mere woods-runner lately brought to Ulfgard for Father to bed.<br>Nonetheless, new and strange, she had caught Gunnhild's eager heed. "I'll go too!" the girl cried.<br>Mother half rose from the high seat she shared with Father. "You will not," she answered. "A child of seven winters? A granddaughter of R�gnvald Jarl, trotting after a Finn? Hush your witlessness."<br>"I would know better," said brother Eyvind loftily. "Unless, of course, a foe was upon us."<br>Gunnhild stamped her foot on the clay floor. "I will; I will."<br>�zur grinned anew, wryly now. It's not worth a fight, as headstrong as you are," he deemed. "Take a warm cloak and keep dry, or I shall be angry. Yngvar, watch her."<br>The man nodded and went for his own cloak and a spear. Kraka leaned back with a sigh. She was a haughty one, whose husband mostly let her do what she wanted to, but she had learned not to gainsay him.<br>The three passed through entryroom and door. Gunnhild stopped on the flagstones. Wind yelled. Astounded, she let go of her woolen mantle. It flapped back like wings. "O-o-oh," she breathed.<br>The sky was a storm of northlights. They shuddered and billowed, huge frost-cold banners and sails, whiteness streaked with ice blue, flame red, cat's-eye green. Their silence scorned every noise of earth. A few stars glimmered low and lonely southward.<br>Seija stretched forth an arm from her wrap. Her fingers writhed. Through the wind Gunnhild heard her sing, a high wailing in her unknown tongue.<br>"What's that?" asked the girl. Chill bit. She gathered her garb close.<br>"I make safe. Ghosts dance. Many strong ghosts."<br>Gunnhild had seen northlights before, though none like these. "I heard--Father told us--it's the watchfires of the gods."<br>"Troll-fires, <i>I</i> think," growled Yngvar. He drew the sign of the Hammer.<br>Seija stilled her spellcraft and led the way down the path from the hall and its outbuildings. While no moon was aloft, one could see almost clearly. They reached the strand. The woman walked to and fro, hunched, head bent so that the cowl made her faceless, casting about. Maybe she whispered. Tide had washed away the fish guts and scales that would have helped. Only a narrow stretch of cobbles was left, sheening wet. Kelp sprawled in swart heaps and ropes. The wind scattered its sharp smell.<br>Gunnhild stayed beside Yngvar. Awe rolled over her.<br>Behind, the bank lifted steeply to where the roof of the hall loomed black, with ridges and crests hoar beyond. On her right the wharf jutted alongside the ship-house, two darknesses. Nighted likewise were the heights across the inlet. Even here, waves ran wild, spume blowing off their manes, stones grinding underneath. They broke a ways off. The water then rushed at the land, poured back with a hollow roar, and came again, farther each time. Peering past this as the wind lashed tears from her eyes, she saw the open fjord gone berserk, outward to the sea. Northlight shimmered and flashed over it.<br>A thrilling passed through Gunnhild. The mightiness!<br>Seija halted. She took off her cloak, weighted it with her shoes, raised her skirt, and waded out. The flow dashed halfway to her knees. Spindrift flew, a salt rain. She bent down to grope. After a little, she straightened. Something gleamed in her hand. She went ashore. Drenched, her gown clung to a short, sturdy frame. Running to meet her, Gunnhild saw that she held a bone-hafted knife, surely <i>the</i> knife. "We go home," she said.<br>Gunnhild stood wondersmitten. Witch-sight indeed? Yet the woman shivered with cold and the night dwarfed her.<br>A fire-streak lanced into the sea. Gunnhild gasped. She had never beheld a falling star so lightninglike ablaze.<br>"There Odin cast his spear." Yngvar's voice was not altogether steady. Did he believe what he said? At the end of the world, all the stars will fall from heaven.<br>Seija sang a stave. What did she think? She made for the path. At the top waited warm earthly fire. Gunnhild lingered till Yngvar urged her along. She wanted to show the Beings who raved abroad that she was not afraid. She would not let herself be afraid.<br>&nbsp;<br>Copyright � 2001 by Trigonier Trust</p><h2>Adolph Gottlieb: A Retrospective</h2><p>Adolph Gottlieb (1903-1974) was one of the leaders of the New York School of Abstract Expressionism.

Opium entered China during the Middle Ages when Arab traders brought it into China for medicinal purposes. As it took hold as a recreational drug, opium wrought havoc on Chinese society. By the early nineteenth century, 90 percent of the Emperor's court and the majority of the army were opium addicts.<br><br>Britain was also a nation addicted-to tea, grown in China, and paid for with profits made from the opium trade. When China tried to ban the use of the drug and bar its Western smugglers from it gates, England decided to fight to keep open China's ports for its importation. England, the superpower of its time, managed to do so in two wars, resulting in a drug-induced devastation of the Chinese people that would last 150 years.<br><br>In this page-turning, dramatic and colorful history, The Opium Wars responds to past, biased Western accounts by representing the neglected Chinese version of the story and showing how the wars stand as one of the monumental clashes between the cultures of East and West.<br><br>"A fine popular account."-Publishers Weekly<br><br>"Their account of the causes, military campaigns and tragic effects of these wars is absorbing, frequently macabre and deeply unsettling."-Booklist</p><p>Historian W. Travis Hanes III, PhD is an internationally recognised expert on nineteenth-century Britain and holds a doctorate in British Imperial History. Frank Sanello has written numerous books on history and film.Hanes (Imperial Diplomacy in the Era of Decolonization) and film author and former Los Angeles Daily News critic Sanello have teamed up to produce this fine popular account. Beginning in the 18th century, British merchants quickly discovered that by introducing high-quality opium into China, they could earn high profits and use the hard currency to buy more tea. As a result, Chinese society became inundated with opium, and more and more people, including much of the army, became addicted. Twice, from 1839 to 1842 and again from 1856 until 1860, the Chinese government sought to oust the British trade. Hanes and Sanello describe in detail the military operations of both wars, the few Chinese successes and inexorable British wave of victories, culminating in the 1860 sacking and looting of the Imperial Summer Palace and its sumptuous works of art. The opium saturation of China continued until the post-WWII communist takeover, when the Maoist government banned opium, executed dealers and weaned the country (perhaps 10% of the population was addicted) off the drug with progressive rehab programs. The book covers a familiar time and place in history, but the authors make some nice analogies between the brutal economics and empire of the 19th century, and 21st- century forms of money, politics and war.<br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Complete Little Orphan Annie Volume 11</h2><p><ul> <li>In the depths of the Second World War, Harold Gray paints a dark vision of stateside America when Annie&#x2019;s most loyal friends turn out to be a boarding house full of thieves, forgers, and mindreaders.

Recently arrived at her uncle's estate,&nbsp;&nbsp;orphaned Mary Lennox is spoiled, sickly, and&nbsp;&nbsp;certain she won't enjoy living there. Then she discovers&nbsp;&nbsp;the arched doorway into an overgrown garden, shut&nbsp;&nbsp;up since the death of her aunt ten years earlier.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary soon begins transforming it into a thing of&nbsp;&nbsp;beauty--unaware that she is changing&nbsp;&nbsp;too.<br>But Misselthwaite hides another secret, as&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary discovers one night. High in a dark room, away&nbsp;&nbsp;from the rest of the house, lies her young cousin,&nbsp;&nbsp;Colin, who believes he is an incurable invalid,&nbsp;&nbsp;destined to die young. His tantrums are so&nbsp;&nbsp;frightful, no one can reason with him. If only, Mary hopes,&nbsp;&nbsp;she can get Colin to love the secret garden as&nbsp;&nbsp;much as she does, its magic will work wonders on him.</p><p>Mistress Mary is quite contrary until she helps her garden grow. Along the way, she manages to cure her sickly cousin Colin, who is every bit as imperious as she. These two are sullen little peas in a pod, closed up in a gloomy old manor on the Yorkshire moors of England, until a locked-up garden captures their imaginations and puts the blush of a wild rose in their cheeks; "It was the sweetest, most mysterious-looking place any one could imagine. The high walls which shut it in were covered with the leafless stems of roses which were so thick, that they matted together.... 'No wonder it is still,' Mary whispered. 'I am the first person who has spoken here for ten years.'" As new life sprouts from the earth, Mary and Colin's sour natures begin to sweeten. For anyone who has ever felt afraid to live and love, <i>The Secret Garden</i>'s portrayal of reawakening spirits will thrill and rejuvenate.

If your answer is yes, then I'm happy to tell you you've arrived at the right place! One big part of taking responsibility for our health is to be able to open our eyes and accept the fact that most of the things we've learned thus far in our lives about health have been completely, utterly WRONG. Just like the toothpaste containing fluoride you've been using your whole life, has now turned out to be poisonous, destructive for our bones and causes fertility issues. Or what about the popular deodorant brands out there? Most of them contains hazardous chemicals that can cause breast cancer in women and prostate cancer in men, as well as an increased risk of Alzheimer's Disease. Whether you're hearing this information for the first time, or have heard it before, I think we both can agree this is SHOCKING information, and that we're in need of a NEW, non-toxic, natural solution for our every day needs. Whether it be shampoos, cleaning supplies, body lotions, make up removers, deodorants... Truth is, we pretty much need our own homemade solution to everything as we shouldn't trust anyone with our precious health anymore but ourselves. Essential oils can be amongst one of our little helpers, and I&#x2019;m happy with that! "Now, what about pain - or illnesses, can essential oils help in that as well?&#x201d; Yes, absolutely it can. If you're like me, then I'm guessing you're sick of ingesting toxic prescription drugs from the big pharmacies that have more negative side effects than you can even count.

Before you read on and really dive into my books let me introduce myself...My name is Joy Louis, I&#39;m originally from Fort Lauderdale, FL but now live in Los Angeles with my husband Rob. I&#39;m an all Natural-Organic-Homemade &#34;Everything&#34; Person. My &#34;all natural&#34; way of living started a few years back when I was sick and tired of being sick, FAT and tired. I was eating pretty healthy (or so I thought): I ate peanut butter jelly sandwiches for lunch every day, snacked on cereal protein bars in between meals (these are healthy, right?) and drank Diet Coke (because isn&#39;t Diet Coke better than sugar? No calories versus a mother lode of sugar that would go straight to my butt. I&#39;ll take the &#34;no sugar&#34; please and thank you). However, despite living my so-called &#34;healthy&#34; lifestyle, I kept gaining weight, and lost all energy and motivation to do anything; I even started to dread taking my dearest Pretzel (my sweet dog of 7 years) out for her daily walk around the neighborhood! That&#39;s when I knew I&#39;d had enough. I decided to start searching for a better way; a way that has now proven to give me more energy than I ever imagined possible and also helped me lose 45 pounds of stubborn body fat in the process. I made a drastic change, 180-degree turn in all my habits. So here it is. My so called &#34;secret, hidden formula&#34; I used to get to where I am today is: I went ALL NATURAL. Not a very sexy answer, is it? Well I have to tell you, a lot of times we complicate things way too much when looking for an answer. More often than not the solution to our problems is very simple. However... simple doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s easy - far from it! As for myself, I use them in almost everything. They&#39;re my go-to problem solver, my all-natural medicine cabinet. No more artificial pain killers or medicine with a hundred possible side effects. Essential oils keep my food cravings in check, clear out my sinuses when feel a cold coming on, straighten out the wrinkles and lines coming on in my face, and uplifts my mood the days I feel anxious. For the first time in my life, I can finally say I feel 100% present and alive! I have started to love my body and I have found a true passion in helping others, hence why I decided to write my own books. I truly hope you find my work helpful, and please let me know if you have any questions about any of the content.

And, surprisingly for a man who had been so often damaged by those he trusted, Nixon trusted me immediately. I became a member of his small circle of advisers. I listened as he confided his views on international affairs and world leaders, American politics and policy, Watergate, and his own personal career, and human nature.<br>--Monica Crowley<br><br><b>Nixon off the Record</b> is the unique story of Richard Nixon's intense political life after he left the presidency--told by Monica Crowley, Nixon's foreign-policy assistant and political confidante during the last years of his life.<br><br>With fully reconstructed conversations based on extensive notes made at the time, <b>Nixon off the Record</b> puts the reader in the room with the thirty-seventh president, listening to his views on leadership, his opinions of White House predecessors and successors, his activities and thoughts during the 1992 presidential campaign and election, and his assessment of Bill Clinton's first year in office and his potential challengers in 1996. Nixon's views give voters uncommon criteria by which to measure presidential candidates--including Bob Dole--and their ability to exercise effective leadership.<br><br>Richard Nixon was one of the most controversial and indestructible presidents of the twentieth century. With her privileged perspective and unlimited access to Nixon, Crowley has written a perceptive and spirited memoir that shows not just what Nixon thought in the last years of his life but who he was. She offers an unprecedented behind-the-scenes view of Nixon's activities and opinions, giving the reader a front-row view of recent American political history.<br><br>Nixon's unparalleled experience placed him in a unique position to judge leaders who had come before and after. His assessments are candid, astonishing, and sometimes explosive. This book places those judgments in context and brings them alive for the last American presidential election of the twentieth century.</p><p>A final, purifying apologia by Richard Nixon, as told to Monica Crowley, his young, just-out-of-college assistant, shortly before his death in 1994. Crowley divulges Nixon's disappointment with the Bush re-election campaign, his later efforts to ingratiate himself with the Clinton administration, and his desperate schemes to once again become a key political player. Once the most compelling and infuriating political figure in the last half of the 20th century, <i>Nixon Off The Record</i> reveals that his 20-year exile from the political arena was more painful and humiliating than anyone ever imagined.Monica Crowley was editorial adviser and research consultant for President Nixon's <b>Seize the Moment</b> in 1992 and <b>Beyond Peace</b> in 1994, and traveled to Europe and Asia with him, participating in his meetings with heads of state and other government leaders. She is currently a doctoral candidate at Columbia University and lives in New Jersey.</p><h2>The Kappa Child (Fiction)</h2><p><br><i><b>James Tiptree Jr. Memorial Award for Science Fiction and Commonwealth Writers' Prize Winner, 2001 </b></i><b></b><p><b><i>Sunburst Award Nomination for Canadian Literature of the Fantastic, 2002</i></b> </p><p>From the award-winning author of <i>Chorus of Mushrooms</i>, which won the Commonwealth Writers' Prize for Best First Book in the Caribbean and Canadian Region and was co-winner of the Canada Japan Book Award, <i>The Kappa Child</i> is the tale of four Japanese Canadian sisters struggling to escape the bonds of a family and landscape as inhospitable as the sweltering prairie heat. </p><p>In a family not at all reminiscent of Laura Ingalls Wilder's Little House on the Prairie, four Japanese-Canadian sisters struggle to escape the bonds of a family and landscape as inhospitable as the sweltering prairie heat. Their father, moved by an incredible dream of optimism, decides to migrate from the lush green fields of British Columbia to Alberta. There, he is determined to deny the hard-pan limitations of the prairie and to grow rice.

He received his Bachelor of Arts and Medical degrees from the University of Colorado and lives with his family in Steamboat Springs, Colorado.<p></p> <p><b>Dwight Arnan Williams</b> is a critically acclaimed author of several works of nonfiction and fiction. He resides in Steamboat Springs, Colorado.</p>The haunting story of a man's struggle to survive with a terribly damaged heart. As a youngster, Pensack was diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a progressive disease of the heart muscle and a condition that had killed his mother when he was only five. Assisted here by Williams, a skilled writer, Pensack reveals how his condition has shaped his life from the day of his mother's death to his recent heart transplant at the age of 42. Opening with a harrowing scene in which he very nearly died on his kitchen floor in front of his own three-year-old son, Pensack's story is given immediacy by being told in the first person and the present tense, and it is given impact by the frankness with which he shares the intimate details of the trauma he suffered not only in body but in spirit. As a young man, he imagined that if he could become a doctor he would somehow be able to cure himself, and he set about learning everything he could about his heart condition. In medical school, however, he found himself identifying not with doctors but with corpses and patients. His repeated brushes with death unhinged him emotionally, leaving him at times terrified, isolated, out of touch with reality, and virtually unable to function. Pensack recounts how he eventually came to recognize the symptoms of post-traumatic-stress disorder and to understand that, for him, a particularly severe level of stress would always be a fact of life. When he finally did become a doctor, he chose not cardiology but psychiatry. Pensack's story is filled with vivid descriptions of clinical procedures performed on his body, but more memorable is what he reveals about how living close to death affects the mind. Packs a powerful punch. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Noonan, Jr., demonstrates that the moral teaching of the Catholic Church has changed and continues to change without abandoning its foundational commitment to the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Specifically, Noonan looks at the profound changes that have occurred over the centuries in Catholic moral teaching on freedom of conscience, lending for a profit, and slavery. He also offers a close examination of the change now in progress concerning divorce. &nbsp; In these changes Noonan perceives the Catholic Church to be a vigorous, living organism answering new questions with new answers, and enlarging the capacity of believers to learn through experience and empathy what love demands. He contends that the impetus to change comes from a variety of sources, including prayer, meditation on Scripture, new theological insights and analyses, the evolution of human institutions, and the examples and instruction given by persons of good will. &nbsp; Noonan also states that the Church cannot change its commitment to preaching the Gospel of Jesus Christ.

Noonan, Jr., demonstrates how the moral teaching of the Catholic Church has changed and is changing without abandoning its foundational commitment to the Gospel of Jesus Christ. From St. Paul's return of a runaway slave to his master, to John Henry Newman's startle at the idea that slavery is intrinsically evil, the Church resisted condemning slavery. Today, John Paul II has made clear that slavery in itself, everywhere and always, is sinful. Similar revolutions have occurred in the Church's teaching on making money out of lending and on respect for the beliefs of heretics. And another, little-known change is taking place as modern popes grant divorces. <p>In these changes Noonan perceives the Catholic Church to be a vigorous, living organism answering new questions with new answers and enlarging the capacity of believers to learn through experience and empathy what love demands. He contends that the impetus to change comes from a variety of sources, including prayer, meditation on Scripture, new theological insights and analyses, the evolution of human institutions, and the examples and instruction given by persons of good will. </p><p>Noonan also states that the Church cannot change its commitment to preaching the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Given this absolute, how can the moral teaching of the Church change? Noonan finds this question unanswerable when asked in the abstract. But in the context of the specific facts and events he discusses in this book, an answer becomes clear. As our capacity to grasp the Gospel grows, so do our understanding and compassion, which give life to the Gospel commandments of love. </p><p>Noonan&#x2019;s incisive book, based on the Erasmus Lectures he delivered at the University of Notre Dame in 2003, will challenge anyone interested in the history and future of the Catholic Church.</p>"Having been an office neighbor of Judge John Noonan at the Kluge Center of the Library of Congress while this book was developing, I am delighted to see it in print.

His eventful and controversial life was marked by sharp career moves and academic and ecclesiastical battles. At 28, Ockham was a conservative English theologian focused obsessively on the nature of language, but by 40, he had transformed into a fugitive friar, accused of heresy, and finally protected by the German emperor as he composed incendiary treatises calling for strong limits on papal authority. This book provides a thorough grounding in Ockham&#x2019;s life and his many contributions to philosophy. It begins with an overview of the philosopher's youth and the Aristotelian philosophy he studied as a boy. Subsequent chapters cover his ideas on language and logic; his metaphysics and vaunted "razor," as well as his opponents&#x2019; "anti-razor" theories; his invention of the church-state separation; and much more. The concluding chapter sums up Ockham's compelling philosophical personality and explains his modern appeal.</p><p></p><h2>Red Box</h2><p>A lovely woman is dead, and the fortunes of overextended theatrical producer Llewellyn Frost depend on solving the mystery of the red box: two pounds of candied fruits, nuts and creams, covered with chocolate -- and laced with potassium cyanide. <p>When Nero Wolfe's suspicion falls on Frost's kissing cousin, Frost wants the detective to kill the sickly sweet case--before it kills him. </p><p>"It is always a treat to read a Nero Wolfe mystery.

Pretense design includes all kinds of designed objects: a pair of glasses that looks like a fashion accessory rather than a medical necessity, a hotel in Las Vegas that simulates a Venetian ambience complete with canals and gondolas, boiler plates that look like steel but are vinyl. In this book, Danish designer Per Mollerup defines and describes a ubiquitous design category that until now has not had a name: designed objects with an intentional discrepancy between surface and substance, between appearance and reality. Pretense design, he shows us, is a type of material rhetoric; it is a way for physical objects to speak persuasively, most often to benefit users but sometimes to deceive them.</p><p>After explaining the means and the meanings of pretense design, Mollerup describes four pretense design applications, providing a range of examples for each: beautification, amusement, substitution, and deception. Beautification, he explains, includes sunless tanning, high heels, and even sporty accessories for a family car. Amusement includes forms of irrational otherness&#x2015;columns that don't hold anything up, an old building's fa�ade that hides a new building, a new Chinese town that mimics an old European town. Substitution pretends to be a natural thing: plastic laminate is a substitute for wood, Corian a substitute for marble, and prosthetics substitute for human organs. Deception doesn't just bend the truth; it suspends it. Soldiers wear camouflage to hide; hunters use decoys to attract their prey; malware hides in a harmless program only to wreak havoc on a user's computer. With Pretense Design, Per Mollerup adds a new concept to design thinking.</p></p><p>Per Mollerup is Professor Emeritus of Communication Design at Swinburne University of Technology, Melbourne. He is the author of <i>Wayshowing: A Guide to Environmental Signage</i>, <i>Simplicity: A Matter of Design</i>, and other books.<p>&#x201c;Per Mollerup's explanation of surface is a Rosetta stone for understanding meaning often hidden underneath the veneer of design.&#x201d;</p>&#x2015;<b>Steven Heller</b>, School of Visual Arts MFA Design / Designer as Author + Entrepreneur Program<br><br><p>&#x201c;It is always a delight to read Per Mollerup. He manages to explore what appear to be simple topics and shows that they hide great depth, depths which provide enlightenment and pleasure. His book on 'pretense design' is no exception: revealing where deception, lies, and pretense show up in many guises, sometimes (surprisingly often) for our good, amusement, beautification,&nbsp; and delight, and sometimes for less virtuous motives.&#x201d;</p>&#x2015;<b>Don Norman</b>, Director of The Design Lab at the University of California, San Diego; author of <i>The Design of Everyday Things </i>and<i> Living with Complexity</i><br><br><p>&#x201c;Mollerup gives us a new term to use when discussing design practices that are not overtly dark patterns or persuasive designs. There is another category of intentionally not-what-it-seems design, and pretense design describes it well. In the same way that not all persuasive design is bad (consider fitness apps), Mollerup shows how pretense design can most often improve quality of life, injecting humor, beauty, or added practicality into products and places. Throughout this book he uses clear examples from daily life to help categorize the kinds of pretense design he describes.&#x201d;</p>&#x2015;<b>Chris Nodder</b>, author of <i>Evil by Design</i></p><h2>Cape Cod: Its People and Their History,</h2><p>US History</p><p></p><h2>Divergent Thinking: YA Authors on Veronica Roth&#39;s Divergent Trilogy</h2><p>Veronica Roth&#x2019;s Divergent trilogy (<i>Divergent</i>, <i>Insurgent</i>, <i>Allegiant</i>) has captured the hearts and thoughts of millions of readers.

Sheehan traces his personal journey from his working-class roots through Harvard Law School and his initial career in private practice. His early disenchantment led to his return for further study at Harvard Divinity School, and rethinking the nature of his career. Eventually his role as President and Chief Trial Counselor for the famous Washington, D.C.-based Christic Institute would help define his role as America&#x2019;s preeminent cause lawyer.<br><br>In <i>The People&#x2019;s Advocate</i>, Sheehan details the inside story&#x201d; of over a dozen historically significant American legal cases of the 20th Century, all of which he litigated. The remarkable cases covered in the book include both <i>The Pentagon Papers Case</i> in 1971 and <i>The Watergate Burglary Case</i> in 1973. In addition, Sheehan served as the Chief Attorney on <i>The Karen Silkwood Case</i> in 1976, which additionally revealed the C.I.A.&#x2019;s Israeli Desk had been smuggling 98% bomb-grade plutonium to the State of Israel and to Iran. In 1984, he was the Chief Trial Counsel on <i>The American Sanctuary Movement Case</i>, establishing the right of American church workers to provide assistance to Central American political refugees fleeing Guatemalan and Salvadorian death squads.&#x201d; His involvement with the sanctuary movement ultimately led to Sheehan&#x2019;s famous <i>Iran/Contra Federal Civil Racketeering Case</i> against the Reagan/Bush Administration, which he investigated, initiated, filed, and then litigated. The resulting Iran/Contra Scandal&#x201d; nearly brought down that Administration, leading Congress to consider the impeachment over a dozen of the top-ranking officials of the Reagan/Bush Administration.<br><br><i>The People&#x2019;s Advocate</i> is the real story&#x201d; of these and many other historic American cases, told from the unique point of view of a central lawyer.<br></p><p><b>Daniel Sheehan's</b>&nbsp;43-year legal career is distinguished by his aggressive and successful work as a federal civil rights attorney.

Founded and led by legendary photographer Edward Steichen, the photographers in this unit gave Americans on the home front memorable and dramatic images of the people fighting the Navy's battles in the Pacific theater. Beginning with just half a dozen intrepid shutterbugs and expanding to ten battle-seasoned photographers, the unit covered everything from early aircraft raids to amphibious landings to the surrender in Tokyo Bay. With an estimated 14,000 images in the collection of the National Archives, the work of this talented photographic unit is historically significant not only as a visual record of the war, but also for its influence on generations of postwar photographers. <i>Faces of War</i> is a tribute to the vision of Edward Steichen, as well as the men who served under him, and most importantly to their subjects-the unsung heroes of the U.S. Navy.

She writes on political issues for several national periodicals. Virginia C. Armat, a former editor at &#34;Reader&#39;s Digest,&#34; writes on contemporary issues.Taking aim at advocacy groups who view the homeless as ordinary people down on their luck, the authors of this scorching critique cite findings that 30% to 40% of the homeless suffer from major mental illness, and that a high proportion are substance abusers. Isaac, a sociologist, and freelance journalist Armat, blame the abandonment of the homeless mentally ill on the anti-psychiatry movement (led by Thomas Szasz, Ronald Laing, among others), on civil libertarians and on psychiatrists who foster the "delusion that preventive community psychiatry could eliminate mental illness." Arguing that we have replaced the mental hospital with the 18th-century poorhouse which threw together the mentally ill, the retarded, criminals and the displaced, they warn that a humane system of care will be costly and might involve treatment of some mentally ill persons against their will. Their support for judicious use of electroshock therapy will also stir controversy. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Besieged - Skye&#39;s Legacy</h2><p>Brand New!

Similarly, there has been a growing interest in the cultural meaning of clothing. But curiously, even though people are nearly always clothed, the relationship between dress and the body has been relatively unexplored until now. Dress is a crucial aspect of embodiment, shaping the self physically and psychologically. From dressing up to dressing down, this book exposes the complex ways that fashions and costumes render the body presentable in a vast range of social situations. It investigates the varied ways in which western and non-western clothes operate to give the body meaning and situate it within culture. The authors consider different approaches to the relationship between fashion, dress and the body, and present new theoretical models for their future study. They demonstrate the importance of the concept of &#39;embodiment&#39; to dress and fashion studies. Exploring gender, photography, cultural history and modernity, this book deals with a vast range of questions inherent in dressing up the body. From fashion photography in the 1960s to contemporary queer fashion and the history of the masquerade, this is a fascinating and far-reaching collection. Its breadth and depth make it essential reading for anyone interested in style, costume, the body, gender or history.</p><p>Joanne Entwistle is Senior Research Fellow, London College of Fashion, University of the Arts.

It is still regarded as the classic reference book for hockey players, coaches and spectators.</p><p>Originally published in 1951, and rejected at the time by one NHL coach as "the product of a three-year-old mind," Lloyd Percival's <i>The Hockey Handbook</i> went on to become an internationally recognized classic. Russian and European coaches seized on the book as the first authoritative, analytical treatment of hockey fundamentals and based their training regimes on the principles Percival described. The father of Russian hockey, Anatoli Tarasov, wrote to Percival: "Your wonderful book which introduced us to the mysteries of Canadian hockey, I have read like a schoolboy."<p>Now, nearly half a century later, <i>The Hockey Handbook</i> remains in a class by itself. It is the first book required by players or coaches at all levels of proficiency who are setting out to develop their own or their team's hockey skills.</p><p>Wayne Major, Larry Sadler, and Robert Thom are all experienced amateur hockey coaches who came to appreciate the practical value of Percival's pioneering work. In revising the text, they drew upon the expertise of a variety of specialists, including, for example, Dr. Tom Sawa, who updated the chapter on training and conditioning, to give <i>The Hockey Handbook</i> a new relevance to modern hockey coaches.

Featuring nostalgic images that will encourage you to wake up and eat no matter what time of day, this Retro guide is sure to make anyone an early riser.</p><p>An award-winning watercolor artist, LINDA EVERETT is the author of five other books in the Retro series as well as a freelance writer and researcher for A&amp;E&#x2019;s Biography and MSNBC. Linda resides in Ocean Park, Washington, amid a large collection of cookbooks and recipes. When she&#x2019;s not working on new writing projects, Linda enjoys cooking in her retro-styled kitchen, growing flowers in her garden, and walking her dogs on the beach.Throwing calorie-counting caution to the wind, this newest installment of the Collectors Press&#x2019;s Retro series takes readers back to a time before early morning conference calls and instant coffee, when breakfast really was the most important meal of the day. Complete with nostalgic illustrations and classic advertisements, the book offers more than 125 recipes that recall how nice it was when everyday breakfast consisted of omelets, flapjacks and oatmeal. Time-tested standards like Heart &#x2018;N&#x2019; Soul Biscuits &#x2018;N&#x2019; Gravy and guilty pleasures like New Hampshire Fried Apples are the primary fare here. Those who can&#x2019;t bear to break their diets will be relieved to find a few lighter dishes like Berkeley Health Bars. Some readers may be annoyed to find that the book&#x2019;s heartwarming retro pictures and corny slogans don&#x2019;t always match up with the recipes printed beside them, and vegetarians may get frustrated by the many references to bacon, ham and sausage. But fans of hearty fare should be pleased with this volume, and, as the authors would have us remember, there&#x2019;s always room for breakfast at the dinner table. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Salman Rushdie hauls his hero, Malik Solanka, from Bombay to London to New York, and finally to a fictional Third World country, all in order to show off a preternatural ability to riff on anything from Bollywood musicals to revolutionary politics. Professor Solanka is propelled on this path by his strange love of dolls. He plays with them as a child; as an adult he quits his post at Cambridge in order to produce a TV show wherein an animated doll, Little Brain, meets the great thinkers of history. Little Brain becomes a smash hit, and perhaps inevitably, Solanka finds himself in America. (It's not only the show-biz version of manifest destiny that brings him to the New World: one night in London he finds himself standing over the sleeping figures of his beloved wife and child, frighteningly close to stabbing them. This intellectual puppeteer is, of course, fleeing himself.)<p> Now, in New York, he is filled with wrath. Solanka is far from being an Everyman, but his fury is a kind of Everyfury. It's road rage writ large--the natural reaction to an excess of mental traffic. There are several books running simultaneously here: a mystery, a family romance, a bitingly satirical portrait of millennial Manhattan, and a sci-fi revolutionary fantasy. A single fragment gives a sense of Rushdie's reflexive multiplicity: when Solanka finally faces his memories of childhood, he recalls "his damn Yoknapatawpha, his accursed Malgudi." Here's a writer who, leading us into the tender places of his protagonist's soul, stops long enough to reference not just Faulkner but Narayan as well. If it sounds like a bit of a mess, it is. If it sounds frighteningly intelligent, it's that too. <i>--Claire Dederer</i></p>"Life is fury. Fury-sexual, Oedipal, political, magical, brutal- drives us to our finest heights and coarsest depths. This is what we are, what we civilize ourselves to disguise-the terrifying human animal in us, the exalted, transcendent, self-destructive, untrammeled lord of creation. We raise each other to the heights of joy. We tear each other limb from bloody limb." <br>Malik Solanka, historian of ideas and dollmaker extraordinaire, steps out of his life one day, abandons his family without a word of explanation, and flees London for New York. There's a fury within him, and he fears he has become dangerous to those he loves. He arrives in New York at a time of unprecedented plenty, in the highest hour of America's wealth and power, seeking to "erase" himself. Eat me, America, he prays, and give me peace.<br>But fury is all around him. Cabdrivers spout invective. A serial killer is murdering women with a lump of concrete. The petty spats and bone-deep resentments of the metropolis engulf him. His own thoughts, emotions, and desires, meanwhile, are also running wild. A tall, green-eyed young blonde in a D'Angelo Voodoo baseball cap is in store for him. As is another woman, with whom he will fall in love and be drawn toward a different fury, whose roots lie on the far side of the world.<br> <b>Fury</b> is a work of explosive energy, at once a pitiless and pitch-black comedy, a profoundly disturbing inquiry into the darkest side of human nature, and a love story of mesmerizing force. It is also an astonishing portrait of New York. Not since the Bombay of <b>Midnight's Children</b> have a time and place been so intensely and accurately captured in a novel. <br>In his eighth novel, Salman Rushdie brilliantly entwines moments of anger and frenzy with those of humor, honesty, and intimacy. <b>Fury</b> is, above all, a masterly chronicle of the human condition.</p><h2>Growing Up X</h2><p><br>February 21, 1965&#x2013;Malcolm X is assassinated in Harlem&#x2019;s Audubon ballroom, becoming even more inspiring a figure in death than he has been in life.<br><br>June 23, 1997&#x2013;After surviving for a remarkable twenty-two days, his widow, Betty Shabazz, dies of burns suffered in a fire set by her own grandson.<br><br>In the years between, their six daughters reach adulthood, forged by the memory of their parents&#x2019; love, the meaning of their cause, and the power of their faith. Now, at long last, one of them has recorded that touching and tumultuous journey in an unforgettable memoir, <i>Growing Up X</i>.<br><br>Born in 1962, Ilyasah was the middle Shabazz child, a rambunctious live-wire and self-described &#x201c;Mommy&#x2019;s girl&#x201d; who fought for&#x2013;and won&#x2013;attention in an all-female household, a warm place as full of fun as learning, chaos, and love. From the first days after her father&#x2019;s death left the family famous (and homeless) to the years of private schools and personal bodyguards . . . from studying the Muslim faith to understanding the mystery of boys . . . from coming to terms with her father&#x2019;s murder to the shock of her mother&#x2019;s passing, Ilyasah&#x2019;s life is one of stunning contradictions: deprived and privileged, unique and endearingly normal. <br><br>Here is a girl carrying on the legacy of a renowned father and indomitable mother while navigating childhood and, along the way, learning to do the Hustle. Here is a child who was a different color from other kids at camp and then, years later, a young woman not radical enough for her college classmates. Above all else, here is a tribute to a mother of almost unimaginable forbearance, a woman who &#x201c;from that day at the Audubon when she heard the shots and threw her body on our own, [never] stopped shielding her children.&#x201d;<br><br>Written with great warmth and simplicity&#x2013;and featuring reminiscences of famous friends, colleagues, and acquaintances like Coretta Scott King, Muhammad Ali, and Spike Lee&#x2013;<i>Growing Up X</i> is a fascinating, first-ever look at a family many have admired from afar . . . and never seen so close.</p><p>&#x201c;Almost every book is a twice told story. With each reading, the reader can safely say, I read of a life like this somewhere else. <i>Growing Up X</i> is a first told tale. Only Ilyasah Shabazz could have told this story, and however painful the memories, I congratulate her on the courage to remember, the courage to see, and the courage to say what she saw.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;MAYA ANGELOU<br><br>&#x201c;This is a warm and engaging book about how the family of Malcolm X survived and adapted after his assassination in 1965. Ilyasah and his five other daughters were raised by a nurturing and strong mother, Betty Shabazz. The picture painted here is a personal one that helps us to see Malcolm X and his family free from the typical media highlight of his so-called violent rhetoric. Malcolm&#x2019;s main mission, as passed on to his daughter, was to empower black people and to empower his children. <i>Growing Up X</i> is an enlightening contribution to our understanding of the legacy of Malcolm X. This eye-opening book is wonderful reading for all Americans.&#x201d; <br>&#x2013;ALVIN F. POUSSAINT, M.D.<br> Professor of Psychiatry, Harvard Medical School <br><br>&#x201c;Ilyasah Shabazz has written a powerful book that is an inspiration to people of all ages and backgrounds. Her story of living a life burdened with such a powerful legacy touches the inner being of all of us who have endured and overcome the challenges and obstacles put in our path. Ilyasah&#x2019;s tale is a true testament to the power of the human will and, most important, to staying strong in the face of adversity.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;TERRIE M.

Is there a distinctively Catholic way of seeing things? What does the Catholic Church teach about the human condition -- about our lives, our loves, and our destiny? In <em>The Truth of Catholicism</em>, best-selling author George Weigel explores these perennial questions through the prism of ten contemporary controversies.</p><p>The Catholic Church may be the most controversial institution in the world. Some find its teachings inexplicable, puzzling, even cruel. George Weigel suggests that we look at Catholicism and its controversies from "inside" the convictions that make those controversies not only possible, but necessary The truths of Catholicism then come into clearer focus as affirmations and celebrations of human life and human love, even as they challenge us to imagine a daring future for humanity and for ourselves.</p><p>Is Jesus uniquely the savior of the world? Does belief in God limit our freedom? What are we doing when we pray? Is the moral life about rules or about happiness? Doesn't suffering contradict the biblical claim that God is good? How does the Catholic Church think about other Christians and about other great world religions? Are Catholics safe for democracy? What will become of us? In an engaging, accessible style, George Weigel leads us through these and other questions into the truth of Catholicism: the truth about a God passionately in love with his creation, the truth about a love that creates a vast, liberating terrain on which to live a fully human life.</p></p><p>In <i>The Truth of Catholicism</i>, John Paul II's biographer George Weigel tackles 10 of the most controversial and complex questions for which the Catholic Church provides answers. The subjects of these questions include the uniqueness of Christ, the meaning of freedom, the dignity of human life from conception until natural death, and the use and abuse of sex. Weigel writes as a committed Catholic, and he asks that readers of all faiths suspend their disbelief while reading his book. "By 'coming inside' and seeing how the Catholic vision of the human condition and the human prospect fit together," Weigel explains, "both the curious and the discontented will, it is hoped, be able to see the affirmation and celebration of the human project in Catholicism, not condemnation and mindless prohibition." Weigel's project is worthy, his chosen questions are important ones, and his answers are easily understood and often persuasive. Nevertheless, his choice not to acknowledge the political dynamic of "condemnation and mindless prohibition" that mitigates many of Catholicism's truths is unfortunate, as those worldly dynamics are as real as divine revelation, and will always be, as long as we live in a fallen world. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i><p>George Weigel is one of the world's foremost authorities on the Catholic Church and the author of the <em>New York Times</em> bestseller Witness to <em>Hope: The Biography of Pope John Paul II</em>. He is a Senior Fellow of the Ethics and Public Policy Center in Washington, D.C., and a consultant on Vatican affairs for NBC News.</p></p><h2>The Enigma of Japanese Power</h2><p>A full-scale examination of the inner workings of Japan's political and industrial system.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><p>Few Americans have examined carefully the nation whose economy and industry is bound up with their own, whose future will inescapably shape theirs--Japan, that is. Dutch journalist Karel van Wolferen does the job, and very well indeed, depicting a Japan alternately awed and disgusted by the world beyond its shores, governed by a puppet emperor in the service of the <i>zaikaijin</i>, a gerontocracy of businessmen who control the national economy, just as they have done for generations. Their hierarchy is reinforced by the fear that, as in 1945, hostile powers will not only overpower the Japanese economy but denature the Japanese people, introducing foreign concepts of democracy and even the specter of an "impure race." Although Van Wolferen balances his account by highlighting what he regards as positive Japanese traits, including thrift, respect for elders, industriousness, and self-control, <i>The Enigma of Japanese Power</i> remains a controversial text in the nation it assays to describe with discomforting accuracy.A full-scale examination of the inner workings of Japan&#39;s political and industrial system.</p><h2>Running The Amazon</h2><p>Sm Quarto, 1989, PP.277, The Firsthand Account Of The Only Expedition Ever To Travel The Entire 4200 Mile Amazon River</p><p>In 1985 a team of hand-picked adventurers, including writer Joe Kane, embarked on a journey that would take them to the remote headwaters of the Amazon Basin. But that was just the beginning of the trip. Their goal: to navigate the world's longest river from source to mouth, a feat never before recorded. <p> After reaching (via a goat trail) a glacial trickle above 17,000 feet--debatably the farthest source of the Amazon--the team descends to a point where kayaks can be deployed. From there the trip entails kayaking through one of the nastiest white-water canyons on the planet, a stretch of water that has previously claimed the lives or quickly halted the plans of all who attempted to conquer it; navigating an unmapped gorge known affectionately as the Abyss; sneaking through the "Red Zone," an area closed to foreigners and occupied by the notorious Shining Path rebels; and, finally, paddling to the Atlantic by sea kayak through 3,000 miles of hot jungle. </p><p> Hired initially to chronicle the project from dry land, Kane quickly assumes a more integral role as a much-needed paddler, and as such he is able to provide vivid, first-hand descriptions of the treacherous water encountered. But in many ways the water is the least imposing obstacle to success. Along the way the team is beset by financial difficulties, a crisis of leadership, attacks from armed rebels, and the defection of team members. Kane's account of this six-month ordeal is much more than a travelogue of athletic endeavor--it's a fascinating portrait of the planning, politics, and personal struggles involved in mounting a modern-day expedition through a vast expanse of largely uncharted territory.</p>9 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Pat the Bunny : Let&#39;s Find Bunny</h2><p>This lift the flap board book plays peek a boo with a child while looking for bunny.<br></p><p></p><h2>The World of the Dark Crystal: The Collector&#39;s Edition</h2><p>Drawings depict the inhabitants and ancient culture of an unusual fantasy world.</p><p>Brian Froud, award-winning artist, author, and designer, served as the concept designer of Jim Henson's films <i>The Dark Crystal</i> and <i>Labyrinth</i>. He is also the best-selling author of Abrams' newly released <i>Lady Cottington's Fairy Album</i>, as well as such blockbuster hits as <i>Good Faeries/Bad Faeries, Lady Cottington's Pressed Fairy Album</i> (with Terry Jones), and <i>Faeries</i>, his million-plus-copy bestseller, co-authored with Alan Lee and just re-released by Abrams in a special 25th-anniversary edition. Froud lives with his wife and son in Devon, England.This lavish, oversized picture book revisits the collaboration between Froud, prominent fairy artist, and Jim Hensen, Muppeteer, in the creation of their cult favorite The Dark Crystal. Reissued after 20 years, this portfolio of sketches and backdrop paintings retains a certain mystique, crammed to the margins with moss-covered runes and medieval diagrams, and peopled by the movie's menagerie of grotesque, shambling puppets. Unfortunately, the narrative fails to support the elaborate art direction, offering a dim echo of the Lord of the Rings with none of the complexity or scope. The long-nosed Gelflings and vulturish Skeksis-as well as the whole hodge-podge of occult symbols and carefully antiquated tools-come across as strangely arbitrary, constantly reaching for a profundity that never appears. But for the many fans of the movie and young children interested in fantasy-adventure, the book will satisfy greatly. Also included in the package is a preliminary 20-page sketchbook for the production, unseen until now. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Substitute Guest (Grace Livingston Hill #20)</h2><p>Caught in a raging blizzard, handsome Alan Monteith seeks refuge among strangers&#x2015;and discovers true love. <br><br><b>Grace Livingston Hill</b> is the beloved author of more than 100 books.

Yetnikoff knew most of the stars and embraced all the excesses of this era: he was mentor to Streisand, father confessor to Michael Jackson, shared a mistress with Marvin Gaye and came to blows with Mick Jagger. He feuded with David Geffen and outmanoeuvred Rupert Murdoch. He was also addicted to cocaine and alcohol - until his doctor gave him just 3 months to live. Yetnikoff came from a working-class Jewish family from Brooklyn; he graduated from law school in the 1950s and proceeded to climb the corporate ladder to the very top. His high-flying ended in breakdown, but throughout his rise and fall, Yetnikoff remained a man of huge charisma and disarming charm. Howling at the Moon is written with David Ritz, the only 4-time winner of the Ralph J Gleason Music Book award, who has collaborated on the autobiographies of such stars as Ray Charles, BB King, Aretha Franklin and Etta James.</p><p>Born in Brooklyn in 1933 and graduating from law school in the 1950s, Walter Yetnikoff went on to become president of CBS Records from 1975 to 1990, creating the most prestigious and profitable stable of artists in music history.It provides a stream of fabulous anecdotes -a fight with Mick, a shared mistress with Marvin, and several disturbing encounters with MJ, who called him &#34;Good Daddy&#34;&#39; ARENA * `His stories of the whispering venality of the image-obsessed young Michael Jackson wanting to renege on deals while appearing squeaky clean are very revealing . . .

Coverage is not limited to the war trials but is presented in the form of profiles of Nazism's most brutal villains. While the names Heinrich Himmler, Adolf Eichmann, and Josef Mengele may be familiar to a number of young readers, Julius Streicher, Reinhard Heydrich, and Rudolf Hoss most likely will not be. The book is enhanced by informative sidebars, a cogent use of appropriate quotations, excellent black-and-white historic photographs, and an extensive bibliography.</p><p><i>David A.

(That Sell!)</h2><p>Shows marketing and advertising professionals how to defy rules by developing outrageous ideas that will sell products</p><p>Famous adman Lois (George, Be Careful, 1972, also coauthored with Pitts), currently head honcho of the Lois/GGK agency, hawks his wares with all the insistence of a rock star bawling, ``I want my MTV'' (a campaign for which he proudly takes the rap). It's Lois's thesis that great advertising requires one ``big idea.'' This is a book about advertising, all right, but don't look for much practical instruction--unless it's this: To be as successful as Lois has been, simply be a genius like Lois. Unstinting in his own praise, Lois proudly recounts each of his many campaigns as ``an extraordinary tour de force,'' a ``brilliant strategy,'' ``skillful,'' and so forth ad nauseam. It's enough to make Muhammad Ali blush. Read about how Lois saved cable TV, the airline industry, Xerox, the Greek tourist business, The New York Herald Tribune, and Dilly Beans. ``Hip'' and ``sassy,'' the ``crazy Greek'' (as he likes to characterize himself) claims it was he who sold a Nazi car (Volkswagen) to New York Jews and kept USA Today on the stands. And don't forget those wonderful Esquire covers. His way of asserting a proposition: ``If you don't agree it's possible, stop reading.'' There are a few anecdotes, but nothing without the headliner Lois. Strangely, he becomes almost engaging in his single-minded devotion to self. In his first few pages, Lois offers a ``distinct break-away from the David Ogilvy `school' of advertising.'' Indeed, he seems to have an attitude about ``the reigning magistrate,'' Ogilvy. It's interesting to note, then, that early in Ogilvy on Advertising (1983), the magistrate asks, in bold-face type (you guessed it): ``What's the big idea?'' An incredibly immodest, modestly credible promotion by a durable ``creative'' huckster, perhaps more revealing than intended. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

And it didn&#x2019;t seem like the good kind of weird, like the eccentric arty weird that could be appreciated by other people.&#x201d; If you can relate, pick this one up.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Huffington Post</i></p> <p>&#x201c;This is the book on top of the stack, which means it is getting the most play currently. Chelsea Martin writes great millennial essays that make you forget that 'millennial' is usually treated as a pejorative.

They are personal, revealing, funny, and wince-inducing all at once. Martin grew up poor in a poor California town, and here she lays it all out: her struggles with family, love, sex, money, illness, and more. This is a quick read, and one that will stay with you.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Book Riot</i></p> <p>&#x201c;Funny, candid, and searchingly self-aware, this essay collection tells the story of Chelsea Martin&#x2019;s coming of age as an artist. A book about relationships, class, art, sex, money, and family&#x2015;and about growing up weird, and poor, in the late 1990s and early 2000s.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Rumpus</i></p> <p>&#x201c;Martin is an incredibly entertaining writer, one who&#x2015;as the title of her book suggests&#x2015;is willing to take a few risks, and to mix the high with the low.&#x201d; &#x2015;Jonathan Lee, <i>BOMB Magazine</i></p> <p>&#x201c;In these essays, Martin is bold and unflinching, poking and prodding at herself and her memories and motivations . . . A lesser writer would tell these stories as cute anecdotes, and the result would have been a funny, perfectly enjoyable book. But these essays go further than that, probing deeply into not just Martin&#x2019;s own experiences but what these experiences say about more complex themes such as place, class, and identity. Because of this, Caca Dolce doesn&#x2019;t fall into that often-cited pitfall of the genre as being mere 'navel gazing,' and is instead incredibly nuanced, relatable, and wholly distinctive.&#x201d; &#x2015;Juliet Escoria, <i>Electric Literature</i></p> <p>&#x201c;The essays in <i>Caca Dolce</i> are raw, unflinching and deeply personal, written in a detailed narrative style that places the reader alongside Martin as she relives each memory, interweaving thoughts from the now 30-something author to contextualize her younger self's inner monologues.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Inlander</i></p> <p>&#x201c;I found each and every person you write about in this book as people you love and care about. Deeply. The person I most related to besides the narrator was your father and step-father. I kept thinking what if I was in this situation? What if certain things in my life turned out differently? How would I be? What would it be like to raise a daughter who was ten times smarter than me when she was ten? Life is an impossible situation and folks are just doing the best they can. You show us this in your book. Anyone with any sense can see this. In terms of your siblings&#x2015;I would have died to have such an amazing artist as a sister. I&#x2019;m sure they will see this too. If not now, then someday.&#x201d; &#x2015;Scott McClanahan, <i>The Fanzine</i></p> <p>&#x201c;Ever since she started garnering praise in the 'alt lit' scene, Chelsea Martin has stood out as one of the most honest, unpretentious, and hilarious authors alive, and her new book, sub-titled 'Essays from a Lowbrow Life' exemplifies each of those qualities. It is a brutally self-deprecating, yet entirely relatable and moving memoir of an eccentric child of the Internet.

Gold, gold I tell ya." &#x2015;Mary Miller, author of <i>The Last Days of California</i></p> <p>&#x201c;Chelsea Martin is one of the best American writers alive. Savage and sharp, tender and hilarious, Martin&#x2019;s <i>Caca Dolce</i> is a book like she&#x2019;s never written before. She&#x2019;s given us poetry, prose, novels, and comics. Now she&#x2019;s given us a perfect personal essay collection as well. You'll only think one thing after reading it. Chelsea Martin can do anything.&#x201d;&#x2015;Scott McClanahan, author of <i>Hill William</i></p> <p>&#x201c;<i>Caca Dolce</i> explores the discomfort, melancholia and absurdity of taking up space in the world when we aren't sure if we really deserve it.

Refreshing, hilarious, self-deprecating, as far from pretentious as you can get&#x2015;you will find you&#x2019;re no longer alone with your weirdness after reading this book.&#x201d;&#x2015;Molly Brodak, author of <i>Bandit</i></p> <p>&#x201c;This is my favorite book by Chelsea Martin and I&#x2019;ve read every book by her and even published one.

And they are political. In writing them, in deciding to tell her story, on her terms and in her voice, the author has exerted her power&#x2015;even as she writes about so many instances of powerlessness, often a powerlessness unique to being a woman.&#x201d; &#x2015;Shameless</p> <b>Praise for <i>Mickey</i> (2016)</b> <p>&#x201c;Chelsea Martin continues to prove herself the preeminent chronicler of Internet age malaise and I fucking love it. <i>Mickey</i> takes her provocative poetry long form, weaving the tangled tale of a breakup that shouldn't be as confusing as it is.

Himes: A Biography</h2><p><p><strong>Winner of the 2018 Edgar Award for Best Critical/Biographical Work<br> A <em>Washington Post</em> Notable Book<br><br> The definitive biography of the groundbreaking African American author who had an extraordinary legacy on black writers globally.</strong></p><p>Chester B. Himes has been called &#x201c;one of the towering figures of the black literary tradition&#x201d; (Henry Louis Gates Jr.), &#x201c;the best writer of mayhem yarns since Raymond Chandler&#x201d; (<em>San Francisco Chronicle</em>), and &#x201c;a quirky American genius&#x201d; (Walter Mosely). He was the twentieth century&#x2019;s most prolific black writer, captured the spirit of his times expertly, and left a distinctive mark on American literature. Yet today he stands largely forgotten.</p><p>In this definitive biography of Chester B. Himes (1909&#x2013;1984), Lawrence P. Jackson uses exclusive interviews and unrestricted access to Himes&#x2019;s full archives to portray a controversial American writer whose novels unflinchingly confront sex, racism, and black identity. Himes brutally rendered racial politics in the best-selling novel <em>If He Hollers Let Him Go</em>, but he became famous for his Harlem detective series, including <em>Cotton Comes to Harlem</em>. A serious literary tastemaker in his day, Himes had friendships&#x2015;sometimes uneasy&#x2015;with such luminaries as Ralph Ellison, Carl Van Vechten, and Richard Wright.</p><p>Jackson&#x2019;s scholarship and astute commentary illuminates Himes&#x2019;s improbable life&#x2015;his middle-class origins, his eight years in prison, his painful odyssey as a black World War II&#x2013;era artist, and his escape to Europe for success. More than ten years in the writing, Jackson&#x2019;s biography restores the legacy of a fascinating maverick caught between his aspirations for commercial success and his disturbing, vivid portraits of the United States.</p> 20 illustrations</p><p><strong>Lawrence P. Jackson</strong> is Bloomberg Distinguished Professor of English and History at Johns Hopkins University. Author of <em>Ralph Ellison: Emergence of Genius</em>, <em>The Indignant Generation</em>, and <em>My Father&#x2019;s Name</em>, he has been published in <em>n+1</em> and <em>Harper&#x2019;s</em>. He lives in Baltimore, Maryland.&#x201c;Dr. Jackson has presented a much needed view of an important Harlem writer. I had the pleasure of knowing Chester and most of the folk he knew. He was fun. He was good looking. And he was a wonderful story teller. Chester struggled, as most writers do, with being himself. But when he opened the special door to &#x2018;Chester,&#x2019; we all could peep inside to a special genius. He was old and I quite young when we met. He had a flashlight to let me see the way down what could have been a dark road. Chester Himes is to writing what Miles Davis is to the trumpet, what John Coltrane is to the saxophone, what lips are to love. I am so glad this research has been completed. Chester deserves this sun to cast his shadow over the library that is the hope of black Americans.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Nikki Giovanni</strong><br><br>&#x201c;A riveting, one-of-a-kind tale of a writer who saw the subject of race from odd, revealing angles.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Clifford Thompson, <em>Wall Street Journal</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;<em>Chester B.

Confronted by the world of Islam, countless medieval Christians experienced a profound ambivalence, awed by its opulence, they were also troubled by its rival claims to the spiritual inheritance of Abraham and Jesus and humiliated by its social subjugation of non-Muslim minorities. Some converted. Others took up arms. Still others, the subjects of John Tolan's study of anti-Muslim polemics in medieval Europe, undertook to attack Islam and its most vivid avatar, the saracen, with words.<br><br>In an effort to make sense of God's apparent abandonment of Christendom in favor of a dynamic and expanding Muslim civilization, European writers distorted the teachings of Islam and caricatured its believers in a variety of ways. What ideological purposes did these portrayals serve? And how, in turn, did Muslims view Christianity? Feelings of rivalry, contempt, and superiority existed on both sides, tinged or tempered at times with feelings of doubt, inferiority, curiosity, or admiration. Tolan shows how Christian responses to Islam changed from the seventh to thirteenth centuries, through fast-charging crusades and spirit-crushing defeats, crystallizing into polemical images later drawn upon by Western authors in the fourteenth to twentieth centuries. Saracens explores the social and ideological uses of contempt, explaining how the denigration of the other can be used to defend one's own intellectual construction of the world.</p><p>In an effort to make sense of God&#39;s apparent abandonment of Christendom in favor of a dynamic and expanding Muslim civilization, European writers distorted the teachings of Islam and caricatured its believers in a variety of ways.

Hoskins, archivist for wallpaper manufacturer Sanderson &amp; Sons, has assembled the writings of 15 decorative arts scholars whose goal is to show that wallpaper is a decorative art to be studied, appreciated, and preserved. Somewhat pedantic in writing style, this book succeeds in presenting the beauty of the papers' designs, particularly when showing the exquisitely vivid Chinese wallpapers of the 18th century and 19th-century French scenic papers.

Why do we see these divisions? Why do we care about them so much? Why do we kill and die for them? This is the stuff of news headlines. How has a nation gone from peaceful coexistence to genocide? How does social status affect your health? Why are teenagers willing to kill themselves in hazing rituals in order to belong to a fraternity or social group? How do terrorists learn not to care about the lives of those they attack? US AND THEM gets at the heart of these profound questions by looking at their common root in human nature. Politics, culture, and economics play their parts, but its the human mind that makes them possible, and thats the focus of US AND THEM. Were not born with a map of human kinds; each person makes his own and learns to fight for it. This is a crucial subject that touches all of our lives in ways both large and small, obvious and subtle. Human-kind thinkingwhether beneficial or destructiveis part of human nature, as David Berrebys brilliant book reveals.</p><p>Red States and Blue States Old and Young Christians, Muslims, Hindus, and Buddhists Married and Single Black, White, and Asian SUV owners and Minivan owners There are so many ways to sort people. We all do it, all the time. From everyday decisions (who to invite to dinner?) to life choices (who to marry?) to the great turning points of history (who to war against?), we&#x2019;re guided by an ever-present sense, in any situation, of who belongs with whom, and what that belonging means. Everyone is part of many groups at once, of course &#x2013; you might be a woman, a parent, a Republican, an American, and a Hindu. So how do we decide which identities matter? Why do they matter so much? What makes people willing to die, or to kill, for a religion, nation, race, or caste? <p>In this groundbreaking book, David Berreby shows how science tackles these questions of group identity. Drawing on new findings from anthropology to neuroscience, he argues that this ``tribal&#x2019;&#x2019; sense is a part of human nature, expressing itself in every aspect of life.</p><p>The effects run deep, shaping our lives and opportunities. Us and Them elegantly explains how this tribal sense: � Alters our thoughts: Show older people a negative image of the aged, and they act more feeble. Asian women reminded of their Asian heritage did better on a math test than those who were reminded they were women. In a small room, the lone holdout against a group&#x2019;s opinion usually gives in and changes &#x2013; even when it&#x2019;s obvious that the group is wrong. � Affects our health: People&#x2019;s sense of their place in society directly links to measures of stress, depression, and cholesterol levels � Can be manipulated for both good and ill &#x2013; to make people feel that injustice and oppression are perfectly normal, for instance, or at other times, to help people set aside hatred in favor of reconciliation. One experimenter made a group of young summer campers into warring ``tribes.&#x2019;&#x2019; And, just as easily, he brought them back together. Us and Them explains how and why it&#x2019;s all a matter of how the tribal buttons are pushed. We can&#x2019;t live without our tribal sense. It tells us who we are and how we should behave. It frees us from the narrow confines of the self, linking us to others and the past and the future. Some condemn this instinct, as if it were only a source of evil. Others celebrate it, as if loyalty and faith were never misused. David Berreby brilliantly describes a third alternative: How we can accept and understand our inescapable tribal mind.</p>````Us and Them is thoughtful, witty, and impressively wide-ranging. Drawing on research in biology, neuroscience, and sociology, David Berreby offers a compelling new look at how we divide ourselves against one another." -- Carl Zimmer, author of Soul Made Flesh and Evolution: The Triumph of an Idea <p>"In Us and Them,David Berreby ranges from cutting-edge brain research to today&#x2019;s headlines, and his topic&#x2014;one that lies at the very root of human conflict&#x2014;couldn&#x2019;t be more compelling. Although there may always be some objective basis for a human group, all groups cross-cut and overlap.Our own circumstances and minds determine which groups we give importance to.Everyone should take Berreby&#x2019;s message to heart." &#x2014;Derek Bickerton, author of Language and Species, and Professor of Linguistics, University of Hawai&#x2019;i </p><p>"What makes Them different from Us? The answer, according to this surprising book, may reside in the twists and turns of the brain. In his witty, provocative, and very amiable look at the tribal mind, David Berreby uses modern neuroscience, philosophy, and plain old counterintuitive thinking to explore the psychology of racism, nationalism, religious persecution, social oppression, and all the other ways that humans categorize and then demonize their fellows. He has seen the enemy, and it is Us." &#x2014;Stephen S.Hall,author of Merchants of Immortality </p><p>"David Berreby bravely plunges into the most critical topic of this or any other time, our compulsion for dividing people into good guys and bad guys. Us and Them not only provokes, fascinates, and informs; it is one of those rare books that may actually make a difference." &#x2014;John Horgan,author of The End of Science and Rational Mysticism </p><p> "David Berreby brings wit, charm, and curiosity to his book about the ugliest habits of our species&#x2014;an amazing feat.He steers with a sure hand between the Scylla of earnestness and the Charybdis of detachment while he explains how the psychological, social, and brain sciences are learning about our readiness to divide all humanity intoUs and Them." &#x2014;Jonathan Shay,MD, PhD, author of Achilles in Vietnam</p></p><h2>Heavenly Torah: As Refracted through the Generations</h2><p>Known most widely for his role in the civil rights and peace movements of the 1960s, Abraham Joshua Heschel made major scholarly contributions to the fields of biblical studies, rabbinics, medieval Jewish philosophy, Hasidism, and mysticism. Yet his most ambitious scholarly achievement, his three-volume study of Rabbinic Judaism, is only now appearing in English. Heschel&#39;s great insight is that the world of rabbinic thought can be divided into two types or schools, those of Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Ishmael, and that the historic disputes between the two are based on fundamental differences over the nature of revelation and religion. Furthermore, this disagreement constitutes a basic and necessary ongoing polarity within Judaism between immanence and transcendence, mysticism and rationalism, neo-Platonism and Aristotelianism. Heschel then goes on to show how these two fundamental theologies of revelation may be used to interpret a great number of topics central to Judaism.</p><p>Abraham Joshua Heschel (1907-1972) was a preeminent scholar, acclaimed spiritual writer, and prophetic activist. He was a professor of ethics and mysticism at Jewish Theological Seminary in New York City.Gordon Tucker is senior rabbi of Temple Israel Center in White Plains, NY, and adjunct assistant professor of Jewish philosophy at Jewish Theological Center, New York. He is the editor and translator of &#34;Heavenly Torah as Refracted through the Generations&#34; by Abraham Joshua Heschel.&#x201c;Like Copernicus ... Heschel has set the world on its head ... Without actually examining the evidence, one can hardly be aware of how intrinsically valid is Heschel&#x2019;s hermeneutic principle. Without seeing how thorough and well-disciplined has been his study of Talmudic literature, one cannot fully appreciate his achievement in bringing some order and sense to it ... This is clearly a work of gigantic proportions.&#x201d; &#x2014;Jacob Neusner (Jacob Neusner)<br><br>&#x201c;...one of the most important books in Jewish Studies.&#x201d; &#x2013;Jewish Herald-Voice, November 25, 2004<br><br>&#x201c;This is an ambitious work of tremendous significance, and indispensable guide to understanding the Torah and- consequently- the Jewish religion.

Only on the inside title page do we discover the names of the editors and translators. This act of generosity on the part of Rabbis Tucker and Levin must be acknowledged. But of course, this is entirely Heschel&#x2019;s book, and that is cause enough for radical amazement.&#x201d; &#x2013;Sh&#x2019;ma, January 2005<br><br>&#x201c;...it reveals Heschel&#x2019;s rarely equaled mastery of the entire body of rabbinic, philosophical and mystical literature, both the original sources and the secondary literature.... In his tragically brief lifetime, Heschel represented many role models. He was the hero of modern Jewish theologians, the father of the new Jewish spirituality and the eloquent spokesperson for all who were devoted to repairing our seriously flawed world. These two &#x2018;new&#x2019; books speak to his enduring contributions in all of these areas.&#x201d; &#x2013;The Jewish Week, 12/24/04<br><br>&#x201c;Gordon Tucker (and Leonard Levin) have done a superb job of assembling, editing, abridging and translating a huge, not-quite-finished manuscript. Others literally died trying to translate this sprawling masterpiece....on the whole, the introductions to each chapter, the explanatory notes on almost every page (including identifying Heschel&#x2019;s often obscure sources) are wonderful aids in working through this massive work. Here, now, the greatest Jewish thinker in American history, the true inheritor of Polish Hasidism and German Jewish scholarship, the friend of Martin Luther King and the Pope, our master and teacher, Abraham Joshua Heschel, becomes at last, the major interpreter of classical Judaism.

Highly recommended.&#x201d; &#x2013;Choice, July 2005 (<i>CHOICE</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Citing patterns that underlay the rabbinical passages, the text of Heavenly Torah uncovers the intellectual and spiritual riches of the Talmudic tradition and applies those teachings to the concerns of the modern age. Heavenly Torah is thus a major addition to the library of Religious Humanism in our time. Masterfully brought to the marketplace in a beautiful edition by Continuum Books, who were also responsible for publishing Jonathan Sacks&#x2019; masterpiece The Dignity of Difference, and translated by Gordon Tucker with precision and tremendous knowledge and skill, Heavenly Torah is a seminal addition to our library of Jewish studies.... The English version of the book makes completely transparent the intent and intellectual context of the original-a matter that has been simplified not merely by the clear translation of the texts, citations and footnotes, but by the addition layer of Tucker&#x2019;s own footnotes and illuminating chapter introductions that make Heschel&#x2019;s aims wholly clear to the reader-a matter that is sometimes hard to fully grasp with the dense opacity of the Hebrew original....the English version of the book functions not merely as a brilliantly articulated interweaving of rabbinical texts and ideas, but serves as a general introduction-presented with great clarity and crystalline intelligibility-for the reader who is beginning to learn rabbinical texts.&#x201d; &#x2013;Center for Sephardic Heritage, 4/6/05<br><br>&#x201c;brilliantly translated...a superb job of assembling, abridging, and translating a huge, not-quite-finished manuscript...the introduction to each chapter, the explanatory notes on almost every page are wonderful aids in working through this massive work.&#x201d; &#x2013;Current Theological Writing (Current Theological Writing)</p><h2>1920: The Year of the Six Presidents</h2><p>The presidential election of 1920 was one of the most dramatic ever.

Data for each species include family, common name, maximum adult size, physical characteristics of species, habitat, range, geographical distribution, peculiarities of species, alternative names, and a small, attractive photograph showing the male of the species. Key identification features are labeled; diet requirements, temperament, and tank levels where a particular fish dwells are described. Though this handbook is modestly priced in comparison with Nick Dakin's Macmillan Book of the Marine Aquarium ( LJ 8/93), the physically larger Macmillan volume gives more information on each species and fuller detail on the required aquarium conditions and suitable accompanying fish. Still, this book would be useful as a circulating volume for general collections where needed. --Judith B. Barnett, Pell Marine Science Lib., Univ. of Rhode Island, Kingston<br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.Here's a handy guide that does what Dorling Kindersley's Eyewitness Handbooks do best: use pictures to give readers the information they want and need. In glorious full color, 500 marine and freshwater fish are pictured clearly and large enough to make this an identification manual that fish keepers won't want to be without. The fish are grouped into four general categories (tropical freshwater, cold-water freshwater, tropical marine, cold-water marine), then by family and species. Accompanying each clearly labeled photograph are brief remarks about habitat, behavior, and coloration; a small distribution map; and horizontal bar graphs supplying at-a-glance information on diet, temperament, and size.

The problem, he admits, is that it makes no unearned profits for government or big business. He includes many anecdotes, historical and legendary.</p><p>Gene Logsdon farms in Upper Sandusky, Ohio. He is one of the clearest and most original voices of rural America. His previous Chelsea Green books include The Contrary Farmer and The Contrary Farmer&#39;s Invitation to Gardening.Here we go. Gene &#34;The Contrary Farmer&#34; Logsdon has taken on some controversial subjects in his time, but this time he has bitten off (&#34;sipped on&#34; doesn&#39;t sound right) a topic bound to raise strong feelings on both sides of society&#39;s moral boundary lines. His subject is alcohol and its traditional role on the family homestead. Not surprisingly, Gene speaks the bare-naked truth, and finds a lot more good than bad to say about booze. Alcohol has historically played a significant role in agricultural life. In colonial times it was the most &#34;liquid&#34; alternative to hard currency as a means of exchange. Alcohol was the most reliable, safest, and most convenient way to store the grain harvest, and was an integral commodity on nearly every farmstead. Because it was so valued--does this surprise us?--the government muscled in, looking for its own piece of the action. George Washington was the first of many politicians to regulate alcohol as a means to generate revenues and gain political control. Good Spirits is a rare and brave revisionist view of history. Logsdon is a master at exposing the absurdity of the commonplace. Does it really make sense that the government can make it illegal for us to combine common substances (grain, water, and yeast) on our own property? Can it be true that every war effort in the nation&#39;s history has been fueled literally and figuratively by alcohol and the tax revenues it produces? Why must the farmer fund the government that oppresses him? In between good-natured tirades, Logsdon makes sure the reader learns some valuable lessons. He tells us how to make beer; he teaches the rudiments of distilling; he interviews Booker Noe (patron of America&#39;s First Family of bourbon) to tell us how to sip and tell; and he adds lively tales from alcohol&#39;s quasi-legitimate past. This is vintage Contrary Farmer: 100-proof, single-barrel select. Good Spirits is outrageous, entertaining, enlightening, and an eye-poppingly interesting, natural and holistic look at the role of alcohol. You will savor this book like a snifter of Calvados, the double-distilled apple brandy of Normandy that evaporates on the tongue like a heavenly ambrosia. Heady stuff, but delicious when consumed in moderation.</p><h2>The Element of Fire</h2><p>Scientific magic and fairy magic collide headlong in the threatened kingdom of Ile-Rien, where the Captain of the Queen&#39;s Guard fights a perilous battle standing between opposing forces seeking to topple the kingdom&#39;s weak king</p><p>Martha Wells is the author of a number of fantasy novels, including The Cloud Roads, The Wizard Hunters, and the Nebula-nominated The Death of the Necromancer.In this rich fantasy debut, the medieval-like country of Ile-Rien is threatened by internal turmoil and invasion by the forces of the Fayre. Ile-Rien, ruled in name by weak young King Roland but in fact by the Dowager Queen Ravenna, becomes the staging area for the sorcerer Urbain Grandier's vengeance against his native land, where he had been the victim of an inquisition mounted against magic. Thomas Boniface, captain of the Queen's Guard and Ravenna's former lover, aids the dowager in her fight to maintain stability and counter the pernicious influence of powerful nobles. The political balance is further upset when the court sorcerer dies, weakening the palace's defenses against Fayre and allowing Kade Carrion, the king's illegitimate half-sister, whose mother was the Fayre Queen of Air and Darkness, to return to court after many years of banishment. Skillfully blending the fantastical and the mundane, Wells delights with deft and sympathetic characterization while demonstrating a fine touch for adventure. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Once Upon a Time Map Book</h2><p>An introduction to map reading features six fold-out maps of fantasy lands from some favorite children&#39;s stories, including Peter Pan&#39;s Neverland, Dorothy&#39;s Land of Oz, and Snow White&#39;s Enchanted Forest, and includes a pop-up castle finale.</p><p>Barbara Hennessy lives in the Arizona desert with her husband, three sons and a dog.

He calls upon philosophers to attend to the gap between the present condition of their subject and the human aspirations that philosophy should and once did claim to represent. Putnam&#x2019;s goal is to embed philosophy in social life.</p><p>The first part of this book is dedicated to metaphysical questions. Putnam rejects the contemporary metaphysics that insists on describing both the mind and the world from a God&#x2019;s-eye view. In its place he argues for pluralism, for a philosophy that is not a closed systematic method but a human practice connected to real life. Philosophy has a task, to be sure, but it is not to provide an inventory of the basic furniture of the universe or to separate reality in itself from our own projections. Putnam makes it clear that science is not in the business of describing a ready-made world, and philosophy should not be in that business either.</p><p>The author moves on to show that the larger human context in which science matters is a world of values animated by ethics and aesthetic judgments. No adequate philosophy should try to explain away ethical facts. The dimension of history is added in the third part of the book. Here Putnam takes up a set of American philosophers, some firmly within and others outside the canon of analytic philosophy, such as William James and C. S. Peirce, and he explores the pragmatist contribution to philosophy from James to Quine and Goodman.</p><p>This book connects issues in metaphysics with cultural and literary issues and argues that the collapse of philosophical realism does not entail a fall into the abyss of relativism and postmodern skepticism. It is aimed primarily at philosophers but should appeal to a wide range of humanists and social scientists.</p></p><p><p>Hilary Putnam was Cogan University Professor, Emeritus, at Harvard University.</p><p>James Conant is Chester D. Tripp Professor of Humanities at the University of Chicago.</p>&#x201c;There are many strengths in these essays. Like all his work, they are highly readable; they are on deep and general issues; they contain forceful critiques, particularly of such diverse figures as Ayer and Rorty; and Putnam&#x2019;s first-order views in ethics are compassionate and imaginative...

The sources collected in this volume--spanning two thousand years and including material from Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East--include depictions of peak religious experiences and visions, examples of ecstatic prayer, and counsel on how to keep company with the divine.<br><br>Supplemented with commentary by Louis Jacobs, one of the world's most knowledgeable scholars of Jewish mysticism, these accounts offer an exciting new window on Jewish religious experience and inspiration to spiritual seekers of all persuasions.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><p><i>The Schocken Book of Jewish Mystical Testimonies</i>, edited by Louis Jacobs, is one of the oddest and most interesting books about Kaballah in print. Because, in general, Jewish mystics have been more interested in describing the spiritual realities they have discovered than in reflecting on how these mysteries affected them personally, there's precious little St. Catherine-style God-as-my-lover ecstasy in this book. <i>Jewish Mystical Testimonies</i> may be more useful as a resource for comparing the various techniques Jews have used to attain mystical vision than for learning about what mysticism feels like once the higher levels are reached. Alexander Susskind's urgent advocacy of the advantages of raising the hands in prayer, for instance, or Jacob of Marvege's teaching on the value of fasting, or Aaron Roth's insistence on the need for a personal guru to guide one toward greater illumination, all demonstrate the need for intentional, disciplined preparation before mystical experience can take place. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>"A rich collection of readings in the ancient, hidden Jewish lineage of ascents of the soul."<br>--Daniel Goleman, author of Emotional Intelligence<br><br>"Scintillating accounts of mystical experience that can guide contemporary spiritual seekers through the beyond within."<br>--Daniel C.

Sheila Raj is a recent graduate of a top-ten law school with dreams of working for the ACLU, but law school did not prepare her for the power-hungry sociopath, Judge Helga Friedman, who greets her on her first day. While her beleaguered colleagues begin quitting their jobs, Sheila is assigned to a high-profile death penalty case and suddenly realizes that she has to survive the year as Friedman&#x2019;s chambermaid&nbsp; not just her sanity, but actual lives hang in the balance. With <i>Chambermaid</i> , debut novelist Saira Rao breaks the code of silence surrounding the clerkship and boldly takes us into the mysterious world of the third branch of US government, where the leaders are not elected and can never be fired. With its biting wit and laugh-out-loud humor, this novel will change everything you think you know about how great lawyers, and great judges, are made.</p><p>Here is the legal system exposed and skewered for what it is: haplessly human. Columbia Law School grad Sheila Raj accepts a clerkship from Judge Helga Friedman of the federal court of appeals in Philadelphia, and the world appears to be at her feet. The terrain inside the courthouse turns to quicksand, however, as Sheila discovers Friedman is a sociopathic, homicidal, bipolar jurist who screams at, mocks and otherwise tortures her clerks. Yet Sheila and co-clerks Matthew and Evan must suffer in silence, since the world universally views Judge Friedman as a champion of liberalism. During her tenure, Friedman had nailed cops for racial profiling, overturned a law banning pornography on First Amendment grounds, and nine out of ten times thought company executives were sexually harassing pricks. If she weren't a tyrant who racially profiled her law clerks, she'd be worth idolizing, Sheila laments. This judicial nut job winds up the crucial member of a panel hearing a death penalty appeal that pits her against a rival judge with a dirty little secret that Sheila helps reveal. While Rao's wit shines in her debut, the former TV producer and federal appeals court clerk plays most of the characters for slapstick, which generates more smirks than laughs. <i>(July)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Banned in the Soviet Union until 1988, &#34;Doctor Zhivago&#34; is the epic story of the life and loves of a poet-physician during the turmoil of the Russian Revolution. Taking his family from Moscow to what he hopes will be shelter in the Ural Mountains, Yuri Zhivago finds himself instead embroiled in the battle between the Whites and the Reds, and in love with the tender and beautiful nurse Lara. Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky have restored the rhythms, tone, precision, and poetry of Pasternak&#39;s original, bringing this classic of world literature gloriously to life for a new generation of readers.</p><p>Boris Pasternak was born in Moscow in 1890 and after briefly training as a composer resolved to be a writer. He published a large number of collections of poetry, written under the burden of Soviet Russia&#39;s stringent censorship, before publishing his most famous work, Dr Zhivago, in 1958. This novel won him the Nobel Prize for Literature but the USSR&#39;s hostility to the West meant he was forced to turn it down.

In this incisive, fast-paced biography, Randy Roberts charts the life and career of a man widely regarded as one of the toughest ever to enter the ring. He details Dempsey&#39;s transition from barroom fights to professional boxing and his emerging reputation for fast, brutal knockouts. Roberts draws on a wealth of newspaper articles and interviews to chronicle Dempsey&#39;s rise to the heavyweight championship and his six title defenses. Also included are accounts of the eventual loss of his title to Gene Tunney in 1926, and the rematch in 1927, which Dempsey also lost in the infamous &#34;long count.&#34; After continuing to fight in exhibitions, Dempsey retired from boxing in 1940 with an astonishing 64 victories, 49 of them knockouts. Roberts tells of the building of this record, including accounts of Dempsey&#39;s forays into Hollywood, the controversy over his alleged draft-dodging, his long life after retirement, and his enduring legacy as one of the greatest fighters in boxing history.</p><p>&#34;In a creative and flowing literary style, but with keen attention to detail and judicious analyses of his material, Roberts approaches the heralded heavyweight champion as a legend and symbol of his age. . . . Jack Dempsey: The Manassa Mauler is a first-rate slice of Americana.

Influenced by Hegel, he later reacted against idealist philosophy and began to develop his own theory of historical materialism. He related the state of society to its economic foundations and mode of production, and recommended armed revolution on the part of the proletariat. Together with Engels, who he met in Paris, he wrote the Manifesto of the Communist Party. He lived in England as a refugee until his death in 1888, after participating in an unsuccessful revolution in Germany. Ernst Mandel was a member of the Belgian TUV from 1954 to 1963 and was chosen for the annual Alfred Marshall Lectures by Cambridge University in 1978.

Frost presents a minute-by-minute account of the sea-battle of Jutland 1916, &#x2018;the greatest naval battle of modern times&#x2019; as he describes it. </p><p>Researched until his death in 1935, Frost places the story of the battle in the overall context of World War I and in British naval history. Far from asserting its dominance, the British navy was beginning to adopt a more negative approach, and Jutland was a key outlining of this philosophy, given the British could have been more positive in their attacks. </p><p>Before the battle, exchanges from the air show that the German airships were expert at scouting and bombing, but at little else, as they attempted to bomb British ships on the waters below. Operations on April 25 and May 4 prompted much discussion of the attacks on German airship hangars and setting traps, led by Commander Jellicoe, in the run-up to May 31, the day of battle. </p><p>The British had no unified system of tactical command, which meant they more or less had two fleets operated independently of one another. The Germans, led by Scheer, had a chance to test a fleet that had been assembled at great expense and earn a fabled early victory in the war. Frost is complimentary of their cohesion, courage, self-sacrifice and loyalty, and the morale boost the battle had on Germany&#x2019;s troops on land. </p><p>Frost gives equal time and criticism to the affairs of both sides, concluding that Jellicoe &#x2018;executed a poor conception of war excellently, while Scheer executed an excellent conception of war poorly&#x2019;. </p><p>At Jutland the British ships had a geographical advantage. At stake was the naval command of the Baltic Sea and potential alliance with Russia, cutting off German supplies from Sweden and forcing them to break into their reserves. </p><p>The battle was full of errors in communication and missed opportunities to capitalise on good positions, which Frost describes with precise details. He lays bare the importance of accurate information in transmissions between ships, complete definite articles to denote the enemy. He also refutes any idea that submarines played a role in the battle, even though many of the participants imagined them to be present. Submarines would replace above-water vessels in future naval conflicts. </p><p>There can be no more comprehensive account of one particular sea battle, and for this reason Frost&#x2019;s account stands as an accurate and balanced picture. </p><p>Holloway H. Frost served in the US Navy, rising to Assistant Chief of Staff, Commander Naval Forces Operating in European waters and then onto Commander. He served on board several vessels, commanding the USS Toucey and navigator of the USS California. He taught at the Army War College in Washington. He was awarded the Navy Cross for services to the forces, in particular &#x2018;the development of the tactics of surface vessels and aircraft in combined operations against submarines&#x2019;. He died in 1935, and his book on the Battle of Jutland was published posthumously. </p><p>Albion Press is an imprint of Endeavour Press, the UK's leading independent digital publisher.

But, like most stereotypes, these images distort the complex history and rich cultural heritage of the Apachean peoples, who include the Navajo, as well as the Western, Chiricahua, Mescalero, Jicarilla, Lipan, and Kiowa Apaches. In this pioneering study, Richard Perry synthesizes the findings of anthropology, ethnology, linguistics, archaeology, and ethnohistory to reconstruct the Apachean past and offer a fuller understanding of the forces that have shaped modern Apache culture.</p> <p>While scholars generally agree that the Apacheans are part of a larger group of Athapaskan-speaking peoples who originated in the western Subarctic, there are few archaeological remains to prove when, where, and why those northern cold dwellers migrated to the hot deserts of the American Southwest. Using an innovative method of ethnographic reconstruction, however, Perry hypothesizes that these nomadic hunters were highly adaptable and used to exploiting the resources of a wide range of mountainous habitats. When changes in their surroundings forced the ancient Apacheans to expand their food quest, it was natural for them to migrate down the "mountain corridor" formed by the Rocky Mountain chain.</p> <p>This reconstruction of Apachean history and culture sheds much light on the origins, dispersions, and relationships of Apache groups. Perry is the first researcher to attempt such an extensive reconstruction, and his study is the first to deal with the full range of Athapaskan-speaking peoples. His method will be instructive to students of other cultures who face a similar lack of historical and archaeological data.</p></p><p>Richard J.

With more than two hundred and fifty selected poems by Rilke, including complete translations of the <i>Sonnets to Orpheus </i>and the <i>Duino Elegies</i>, <i>The Poetry of Rilke </i>spans the arc of Rilke&#x2019;s work, from the breakthrough poems of <i>The Book of Hours </i>to the visionary masterpieces written only weeks before his death.

His last years were spent in Switzerland, where he completed his two poetic masterworks, the <i>Duino Elegies </i>and the <i>Sonnets to Orpheus</i>. He died of leukemia in December 1926.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Edward Snow is a professor of English at Rice University. He is the recipient of an American Academy of Arts and Letters Award for his Rilke translations and has twice received the Academy of American Poets&#x2019; Harold Morton Landon Translation Award.</p>Introduction <br>Rereading Rilke by Adam Zagajewski <br>We read Rilke for his poetry, for his prose, for his novel The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge, and for hundreds if not thousands of the letters he left, but there seems to be another important motive too: in our eyes his life pre�sents itself as a .awless example of a modern artist&#x2019;s existence, an example purer perhaps than any other, perfect in its relentless pursuit of beauty. <br>In the German literary tradition it is Johann Wolfgang von Goethe who enjoyed for a very long time the status not only of an immense poet, play�wright, and novelist but also of a sublime role model, an ideal human being, highly successful yet knowing the price of resignation, standing in the middle of a bourgeois society that had just rediscovered the value of intellectual ac�complishment; Goethe, who happily accepted the position of someone who represented more than just his own singular destiny, graciously allowing oth�ers&#x2014;through the numerous windows of his letters, diaries, and conversa�tions&#x2014;to have a look at him in his different hours and moods; Goethe, the scion of a patrician Frankfurt family, who as a young man became a minister at the Weimar court and a scientist entertaining each night in his lovely house on Frauenplan visitors from every imaginable country, explaining to them se�crets of geology, biology, and literature&#x2014;someone Napoleon would wish to meet and, as we know, did meet. Goethe, who renewed the German imagina�tion even as he remained skeptical of the newborn nationalism of his compa�triots during the Napoleonic Wars; Goethe, who was proud of his long life and didn&#x2019;t stop short of mocking others for dying too early; Goethe, a poet and thinker whose spiritual territory was so vast that it encompassed many el�ements of the Enlightenment but also involved vital ingredients of the Ro�mantic era; and .nally, Goethe, who knew well the silence of the writer&#x2019;s study but who also witnessed in 1792the misery of premodern warfare in the mud, hunger, and hopelessness of an unsuccessful military campaign&#x2014;not as a soldier but as an observer sharing the misery of others. <br>And then, next to this giant, Rainer Maria Rilke&#x2014;a dif.dent, homeless poet born on the periphery of the Habsburg Empire, an artist who had to in�vent his own pedigree, who claimed an aristocratic lineage&#x2014;the claim seems rather doubtful&#x2014;an introvert, a lover of solitude, someone who, especially in his later years, didn&#x2019;t care much for publishing and remained until the end of his short life famous only among a rather small group of connoisseurs. Never a minister like Goethe, never a senator like Yeats, never an ambassador like Saint-John Perse. Yes, he enjoyed the company of aristocrats, but not at any court; he&#x2019;d only see them as private persons, gladly when they were set against the background of their natural environment, their castles and palaces: they were for him colorful relics of a more or less imaginary me�dieval Europe. The fact that Duino Castle&#x2014;its name is forever linked to Rilke&#x2019;s poetry&#x2014;which belonged to the Thurn und Taxis family, was de�stroyed in World War I (though later rebuilt) is symptomatic: the aristocrats Rilke knew were the shadows of once powerful magnates. None of the in.u�ential politicians of his time would have thought of meeting him. Clemenceau and Rilke? Lloyd George and Rilke? Lenin and Rilke? No, impossible, ridicu�lous: a joke. Paul Val�ry? Yes, that makes sense; the two poets met and their meeting left a trace, a well-known photograph (but also and foremost Rilke&#x2019;s translations of Val�ry&#x2019;s poetry). <br>What is so attractive for us in Rilke&#x2019;s symbolic status has almost nothing to do with the external circumstances of the period. Unlike Goethe, Rilke was not a robust representative of his epoch; he seemed to be, rather, an elegant question mark on the margin of history. Within the spectrum of literary mod�ernism he stood among the antimoderns (in the sense of being hostile to many characteristics of the newly born industrial civilization), though he didn&#x2019;t care to develop his ideas in any coherent way. He was a poet, not a philosophical journalist, after all. He was like the Chopin of Gottfried Benn&#x2019;s marvelous poem: &#x201c;when Delacroix propounded theories / he grew restless, for his part he could not / explain the Nocturnes.&#x201d; <br>It is his inner discipline, the discipline of his life, the sacri.ces he made, that appeal to us. We cherish a certain intriguing narrowness of his external existence, which we can see and contemplate like an arrow ferociously speed�ing to its ultimate target: Rilke &#x2019;s poetic work. We believe we can see his rich inner life through the veil of his writings. If anything, Rilke was the epoch&#x2019;s secret voice, we think, the epoch&#x2019;s whisper, as opposed to its of.cial expres�sion. This, we think sometimes, is how his time should have been: not the absurd, terrifying killing .elds of Verdun but the tranquillity of the poet&#x2019;s meditation in the midst of a great city or an Alpine meadow. His life spent in travels, his life as a search for the .nal illumination, fascinates us, but also his willingness to learn from Rodin and C�zanne and, later, to teach a young poet what poetry is about. We like to imagine lonely Rilke in Toledo or in Ronda in Spain, or think of him in Rome or in Cairo&#x2014;and we always remember that from each of these travels he would bring with him a few pebbles we later .nd in the splendid mosaic of the Duino Elegies. <br>A lonely person he was, and yet not a stranger to social life. An incredibly proli.c letter writer, he once told Merline&#x2014;the nickname of Baladine Klos�sowska, the mother of Balthus&#x2014;that he had to write 115 letters to make up for a backlog in his correspondence! These letters are extremely interesting, mostly written with the brio of the major artist he was, and should be seen as an important part of his oeuvre (as, for example, in the case of Elizabeth Bishop&#x2019;s letters). <br>The most mesmerizing part of this biography is Rilke&#x2019;s iron-willed wait�ing for the Duino Elegies to arrive, to visit his poetic mind. This is perhaps a unique case in the history of literature: a major poet who expected a certain poem for a long time&#x2014;not any &#x201c;great poem&#x201d; but a particular one&#x2014;appre�hending its very nature, just not receiving it yet. We, the latecomers, know that the .rst four of the ten elegies were written between 1912 and 1914 and that he had to wait eight years for the rest of them. In this perspective, World War I can be regarded as just a very unpleasant nuisance that kept the poems from coming&#x2014;which, by the way, is how Rilke himself often felt about the Great War. He didn&#x2019;t just wait&#x2014;later, after the war was over and new possi�bilities opened up for him, he would, with some help from his friends, more or less actively look for a house, a tower, a quiet place on the planet in which to receive the Angel&#x2019;s message. For this he eventually chose Switzerland, one of the very few European countries not dis.gured by the scars of trenches. The Duino Elegies, as we know, did eventually arrive and gave a glorious meaning to his entire pilgrimage, to his waiting, to his procrastinating, to his moving from one villa to another, to his patience. They gave Rilke&#x2019;s life the shape of a work of art, made him into a twentieth-century emblem of poetry. <br>Nobody will admire Rilke as a father or husband; his phobia of being loved doesn&#x2019;t necessarily convince us, but the form his life acquired through his poetic achievement is awe-inspiring. When Rilke dies in Val-Mont of leukemia (famously not willing to know the name of his illness), we weep, but perhaps a bit less than we would weep for other artists&#x2014;didn&#x2019;t he announce that with the Elegies his work had come to a close? How could he live after them? As a retiree? Collecting stamps? Touring exotic countries with other retirees? Writing more mediocre French poems? Is it possible to be a poet in a more perfect way? <br>Yes, Rilke, the pure artist. At the same time, for some he will be more of a problematic .gure, a freeloader, a half-ridiculous social climber, a snob who impressed a record number of princesses and countesses with his lofty com�portment&#x2014;but also with his writings. Few among the important modern poets have had so many admirers and so many detractors. Paul Claudel, for instance, noted once in his diary: &#x201c;This R. M. Rilke almost started a .ght with me once he understood he meant nothing to me. He was bathed in sadness and mediocrity. Not really poor but a pauper. His poetry is unreadable.&#x201d; Au�guste Rodin had at .rst almost no idea who his secretary was, what his value was. Much later W. H. Auden accepted Rilke &#x2019;s greatness only reluctantly. The list of those unseduced or seduced only against their will is much longer. <br>Rilke has often been presented as an example of an outstanding poet and writer whose beginnings were extremely unassuming, especially when com�pared to the early work of his peers, Hugo von Hofmannsthal or Thomas Mann, whose .rst publications conquered the reading public right away. Hof�mannsthal was well known while still a high school student in Vienna; Mann published his Buddenbrooks at the age of twenty-six (Rilke, an unknown au�thor then, wrote a brilliant review of the novel). Rilke also published as a very young man, but the acclaim he received then was scanty. An anecdote tells of the young Rilke running into the Poet Stefan George in the gardens of Flor�ence (they had brie.y met before in Berlin). George, who was seven years older and who then enjoyed a quiet reputation as someone who had breathed new life into German verse, supposedly told the future author of Malte: &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve started to publish too early.&#x201d; And we know this from Rilke, not from the other poet! This opinion is widespread even now. Rilke&#x2019;s .rst three poetry collections and his youthful naturalistic dramas are frequented by very few readers these days&#x2014;probably only by the most conscientious scholars. Their author himself discarded them. <br>I&#x2019;ve been struck by the fact that the reception of Rilke &#x2019;s work in the United States tends sometimes to obfuscate the context of his oeuvre. Rilke&#x2019;s poetry is often read without much attention to the historic moment in which it appeared&#x2014;I mean both the history of literature and History as such. The second half of the nineteenth century is generally considered a low point in the ongoing saga of German poetry. After Goethe, Schiller, H�lderlin, and the outstanding Romantic poets (Platen, Eichendorff, Uhland, M�rike, Heine) came a time of severe drought. Paradoxically, it coincided with politi�cal success, with the uni.cation of Germany executed under Bismarck&#x2019;s stern command; it seemed that the country of &#x201c;Dichter und Denker&#x201d; had to get rid of high culture (for which it was rightly famous) in order to establish an em�pire in this world, one not made out of dreams. And Bismarck most certainly was not a dreamer. There was almost nothing remarkable in German poetry at the time of Rilke&#x2019;s birth (1875), which of course helps to explain his own anemic beginnings. This was the time when the heart of European poetry beat in Paris (who would believe it now!). And it was the same Stefan George who went to Paris and heard the word from the Master, from the very lips of St�phane Mallarm�. The word was discipline, mystery, elegance, hatred of the bourgeois, rejection of mass production, art for art&#x2019;s sake. Baudelaire was in.uential too, and later Rimbaud. Without George &#x2019;s mediation, but also without the grace of Hofmannsthal&#x2019;s early poems, there would have been no Rilke masterpieces. They, George and Hofmannsthal, were the messengers of modernism in Germany; Rilke learned a lot from them&#x2014;he stood on their shoulders. <br>Weak beginnings . . . Robert Musil, however, in his beautiful speech on Rilke pronounced after his death&#x2014;a text that remains one of the best things ever written about the author of the Duino Elegies&#x2014;saw a unity in the poet&#x2019;s work and wittily claimed that the younger Rilke simply imitated the older one. What a wonderful paradox! Yet it&#x2019;s quite clear that his early work simply re.ected the ornamental taste of the time, the taste of art nouveau, which has dated quite badly, and which gradually evaporated from the pages of Rilke&#x2019;s books. <br>Compared to the other major poets, and not only in the German-speaking countries, Rilke embarked on the path that was supposed to lead him to the heights of poetry with a relatively poor knowledge of the German, or Euro�pean, literary tradition. His formal education was rather thin. But he was lucky in other respects: he met in his youth several individuals who taught him a lot, who in.uenced him in the deepest possible way, though it&#x2019;s not easy to say what exactly he learned from them&#x2014;maybe some kind of human for�mat of greatness. His professors had little to do with any institution, even if he spent some time&#x2014;though not much&#x2014;listening to university lectures. His love affair with Lou Andreas-Salom�, which started when he was twenty-one and she thirty-six and which later was transformed into a lifelong friendship, was certainly highly educational, worth more than any Ivy League school. For a young poet from the provinces, meeting this strikingly original, coura�geous, and brilliant lady was immensely meaningful. That she was the only woman Friedrich Nietzsche ever fell in love with (though apparently she never reciprocated and, as we know from Malraux&#x2019;s memoirs, couldn&#x2019;t even remember if she&#x2019;d exchanged a kiss with him), and that she then wrote one of the earliest well-informed books on the thinker of the eternal return, were of course of great signi.cance. In the 1890s, when Lou Salom� and Rilke met, Nietzsche &#x2019;s fame was skyrocketing in Europe. He himself, as we know, never recovered from the breakdown in Turin; he was still alive but practically un�conscious, nursed by his obnoxious sister Elisabeth, later a Nazi, in Weimar. By then Nietzsche was a numb, humble shadow of the once blissful peripatetic philosopher who used to spend hours climbing the hills that dominated Ra�pallo and the shining Mediterranean in search of Zarathustra. It was a blessing for Rilke: to skip several rungs of the intellectual ladder thanks to a gracious and wise lady, a modern Diotima. <br>Lou Salom� was certainly one of the most dazzling women of her time; when the two of them walked in the meadows in the suburbs of Berlin, bare�foot, as the fashion of the day required, they certainly spoke about the most important things, not just about the weather. She helped him as well with other things: meeting her contributed to tempering his Exaltiertheit&#x2014;as she called his extravagant temperament. For Lou he changed his name&#x2014;from Ren� to Rainer&#x2014;and the shape of his handwriting. That&#x2019;s easy to say, but what it amounts to is an identity transformation. Through her he also met many well-known Berlin intellectuals; thanks to her they noticed his literary existence. <br>Almost all the episodes in Rilke&#x2019;s youth seem to have been instilled with huge didactic value. There were the two trips to Russia (in both of them his companion was Lou Salom�, herself born in St. Petersburg, and speaking Russian perfectly): a short meeting with Tolstoy and a much longer one with the country of his dreams could not replace studying Slavic philology but nonetheless left an important trace on Rilke&#x2019;s entire life and on his poetic thinking. Then came Worpswede in northern Germany, a village that was just becoming famous for its artists&#x2019; colony. Worpswede opened for him new vis�tas in the domain of the visual arts. He lived there for a short while with his wife, Clara, and their young daughter, Ruth. It was in Worpswede also that he would have long conversations with Paula Modersohn Becker, the most tal�ented painter among the local artists. Next came his collaboration with Au�guste Rodin, one of the most fascinating stories in the annals...</p><h2>Wanna Bet? : The Greatest True Stories About Gambling on Golf, from Titanic Thompson to Tiger Woods</h2><p>Golf and gambling go together like irons and woods, caddies and bags, feet and Foot-Joys.

Hardcover with dust jacket, 175 pages, published by Farrar, Straus and Giroux.</p><p>Eric Zencey is a professor of history at Goddard College in Vermont and a contributing editor of <i>North American Review</i>. This is his first novel.This is that extremely rare find, a first novel that is not only extremely accomplished but also quite unlike anything else. It daringly places a real person?American historian and philosopher Henry Adams?into a historic situation?the scandal in 1892 Paris over the corrupt collapse of the grand Panama Canal plan?and makes of it a dashing, sometimes touching and, yes, thoughtful thriller. Adams is sketched quickly and deftly: enterprising, sensitive, observant, still mourning the suicide of his wife years earlier, half in love with beautiful Elizabeth Cameron. We see him briefly in Panama, stealing a picture that will come to be significant; at Mont Saint-Michel and Chartres (naturally), where he is much taken with a young American painter, Miriam, who seems like a new breath in his life, and to whom he becomes quickly, quixotically attached; finally in Paris, where Miriam instantly disappears, is perhaps dead. At once, Adams begins to search for her, becoming involved with Parisian police, including a fledgling fingerprint expert and his young nephew; a coroner is killed, a macabre gift arrives for Adams via a pneumatique and the political plot around the Panama scandal, which could bring down a government and create a new one, thickens. At the heart of it all, Adams barges ahead like a gallant detective with the mind of an aesthete; through his eyes Paris, on the brink of the modern age, has never seemed stranger or more alluring, its people more enigmatic. That Zencey can create a headlong read, with a piercing climax and a poignant final note, out of such esoteric material is almost miraculous.

From there, the book turns back to Horowitz&#39;s privileged and pampered childhood in Kiev, where he started to play the piano at the age of five. We then follow him through his tempestuous years at the Kiev Conservatory, which he entered before he was thirteen and where he was immediately at odds with all of his professors. He was already an individualist. We trace his development as an artist and his defection to Berlin in the turbulent aftermath of the Russian Revolution. We see him in Berlin and Paris, metamorphosed from a provincial to a colossus of the European stage. After his American debut in 1928 he becomes an awe-inspiring figure who is envied by musicians all over the world, exhibiting a kind of high-voltage playing that paralyzed audiences. Yet there was another side to him. There were times when he was invaded by demons, tortured by self-doubts. Author Harold C. Schonberg charts not only the course of Horowitz&#39;s many triumphs but also his mysterious withdrawals from the stage and other troubling aspects of the great pianist&#39;s life. This full portrait of Horowitz&#39;s life and music benefits particularly from hitherto unpublished anecdotes and information that derive from a series of taped interviews the author conducted with Horowitz toward the end of his life. Here is Horowitz the man, the musician, the icon, and even the raconteur. Through Schonberg&#39;s assessment of the special kind of genius that Horowitz brought to the piano and of his position among the other keyboard giants of his time, this biography is a panorama that takes in a good part of this century&#39;s piano world.</p><p>For former New York Times music critic Schonberg, romantic pianist Vladimir Horowitz (1904-1989) was this century's "most potent and electrifying virtuoso," and also a neurotic genius. The temperamental recitalist went through six years of depression and self-loathing beginning in 1932, the year he married Wanda Toscanini, daughter of the famed conductor. Wanda, described here as bitchy and abusive but also fiercely protective, frequently fought with her husband. A hypochrondriac, Horowitz went to spas for imaginary ailments and had an unnecessary appendectomy. His retirement during the years 1953-1965 was prompted, according to Schonberg, by a search for identity and a belief that he had become a flashy showman. Horowitz's sexual preference for men is mentioned in passing. His emotionally disturbed daughter Sonia died in 1975 from an overdose of sleeping pills, feeling rejected by her uncaring father. Filled with wonderful anecdotes, this intimate biography reveals the positive and negative points of Horowitz's personal life, character and playing style. The book, based in part on interviews with Horowtiz taped in 1987, also includes a discography. Photos. Music Book Society main selection. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.Schonberg, a former senior music critic of the New York Times, has written a straightforward account of the great pianist's musical progression through life. He includes many quotes and comments from Horowitz himself and his wife. There is, however, too much detail on performances, too many critics' opinions, and too little insight into the man. For instance, a comment on Horowitz's presumed sexual preference at the time of his marriage is never followed up. The reader is left to wonder whether the matter is connected with the subject's subsequent years of psychiatric treatment. There is also a sense that the man himself is not of much interest outside his musical genius. The book is written in newspaper style, with short sentences and occasional breezy comments or slang words, and snappy phrases like "Berlin . . . was a sad, bad, glad, mad city."

Robert Pinsky, former poet laureate of the United States, plumbs the depths of David&#x2019;s life: his triumphs and his failures, his charm and his cruelty, his divine destiny and his human humiliations. Drawing on the biblical chronicle of David&#x2019;s life as well as on the later commentaries and the Psalms&#x2014;traditionally considered to be David&#x2019;s own words&#x2014;Pinsky teases apart the many strands of David&#x2019;s story and reweaves them into a glorious narrative.<br><br>Under the clarifying and captivating light of Pinsky&#x2019;s erudition and imagination, and his mastery of image and expression, King David&#x2014;both the man and the idea of the man&#x2014;is brought brilliantly to life.</p></p><p>Robert Pinsky is the author of many books of poetry, including Jersey Rain and The Figured Wheel, and of the award-winning translation The Inferno of Dante. His prose works include The Situation of Poetry and The Sounds of Poetry. He teaches in the graduate creative writing program at Boston University and lives in Massachusetts.Think of David, and youthful images spring to mind. There is the boy with the slingshot, forever captured by Michelangelo, ready to take on the giant Goliath. There is the handsome king, in our Hollywood memory played by the young Gregory Peck, who seduces the fetching Bathsheba. But, as Robert Pinsky reminds us in his enriching The Life of David, the drama of David's life is not limited to his youth but extends throughout his 70 years: the upstart lad, the ambitious warrior, the capricious adulterer, the vengeful king, the conniving politician, the suffering father and finally the pathetic old man.<p>Pinsky -- a former poet laureate of the United States, translator of Dante's Inferno and writer of Book World's Poet's Choice column -- never presents David in isolation. We learn that he is neither Achilles nor Romeo, both of whom disappear while still young. David is not Lear, whom we see only in old age, or Beowulf, who is frozen in our minds as the grizzled warrior. "David's drama is that of a life entire," Pinsky writes. The literary references are everywhere -- The Arabian Nights, Scheherazade, Homer, Dryden, Raymond Chandler -- and so, perhaps less effectively, are references to him in contemporary culture -- "The Sopranos," Akira Kurosawa, Oprah, Saudi princes and Wall Street stockbrokers. But Pinsky also delves into rabbinic sources, enriching his narrative by drawing from the Talmud and from Louis Ginzberg's famous The Legends of the Jews.</p><p>In crafting his own take on a complex hero (this book is the first in a series of biographies called "Jewish Encounters," a collaborative effort between Schocken Books and the admirable Jewish cultural group Nextbook), Pinsky demonstrates a love for legend but little patience for apologetics. "Some of the sages," Pinsky writes, "go so far as to claim that David did not sin, that he contemplated the act with Bathsheba but did not go through with it!" Others insist that Uriah the Hittite, being a soldier, had given Bathsheba a bill of divorcement in case he should disappear in battle and thus exonerated David. Pinsky labels such interpretations "desperate" and "inventive almost beyond belief" and suggests that the rabbis who wrote them were "crazed by fasting and exile." He makes it clear that he is looking for the real David -- or as close as we can get to someone who lived nearly 3,000 years ago -- rather than some idealized version. "He must have actually existed, and most of it must be true," Pinsky writes, "because no people would deliberately invent a national hero so deeply flawed." David is indeed flawed, Pinsky adds, "flawed and chosen."</p><p> He also pops up in all sorts of interesting places in the Bible. There's no Book of David; rather, his story and his poetry ramble over several biblical books -- Samuel (1 and 2), Kings (1 and 2), Chronicles (1 and 2), Ruth, Psalms, Isaiah, Ezekiel and Jeremiah, not to mention the Gospels. As a student of the Bible, I knew most of the words and much of the lore that Pinsky cites, but I had never encountered them woven together so artfully and coherently.</p><p>Pinsky reprises the famous narratives of David -- Goliath, Bathsheba, Saul -- but he spends most of his book writing about David's often tragic relationships with his children. Retold here with fresh drama is the story of his eldest son, Amnon, who rapes his half-sister; of Adonijah, who tries to seize the throne; and of the king's youngest, Solomon, who is chosen by David over Adonijah. But the emotional highlight of David's story, as told here, is the death of the rebellious Absalom.</p><p>Pinsky, the critic, analyzes David's famous eulogy: "The king cried with a loud voice, O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!" Pinsky writes, "The poet who wrote great elegies for Saul and Jonathan . . . here is neither stoical or eloquent. Or, his eloquence is in the repetition of a name -- and in what is probably hyperbole: 'Would God I had died for thee.' "</p><p>I always read a book with a mind to its motivation -- wondering why the author picked this topic. Pinsky never really shows his hand, but there is just a hint here that he wrote with his own father in mind. For one thing, the book is dedicated to the memory of his father, Milford Simon Pinsky. For another, the elder Pinsky makes a cameo appearance at the very end of the volume. In discussing David's legacy, Robert Pinsky writes about the Star of David. He focuses on one curious use of that image: a fading photograph from 1939 of 12 young men on a Jewish basketball team in Long Branch, N.J., known as the Jewish Aces. Sewn onto their uniforms is that six-pointed star made of two interlocking triangles. Pinsky goes on to name all 12 players, but the name Milford Pinsky jumps out at me. The son marvels over the ability of the father to wear the star with pride -- and a basketball in hand -- at a time when Europe's Jews were marked for extermination with the same symbol.</p><p>Were the real David to suddenly appear, he would not even recognize the symbol that bears his name and has been used both to ennoble and oppress. In fact, the Star of David didn't come into use until some thousand years after David's death. But, as Pinsky points out in large ways and small, as much as we try to capture David, he is forever larger than life.</p><p>Reviewed by Ari L. Goldman <br>Copyright 2005, The Washington Post.

Major Sean Drummond has to go to Kosovo to investigate a horrific massacre by an elite US Army Special Forces team.</p><p>Sean Drummond is a cocky Army lawyer with a long history in the secret world of special operations. When the legal maverick is assigned by the top brass to investigate a Bosnian massacre in which a Green Beret A-team and the Kosovo Liberation Army detachment they were "advising" got trapped behind Serbian lines, he gets the subtext that's part of his orders. What the Army doesn't need are headlines about the cold-blooded execution of 35 Serbian soldiers, and they're counting on Drummond to clean things up fast, before a public scandal blows dirt all over their medals. Drummond is provided with two associates to help with the investigation: an attractive young woman captain who's a Harvard Law School graduate, and an equally illustrious Judge Army General's Corps lawyer whose reputation precedes him. <p> Once Drummond and his team get to Bosnia, it's clear that the accused Green Berets have their own cover-up going, and they're not going to make it easy for the lawyers to figure out what happened. Drummond has a few tricks up his own sleeve, and when he finds out that his CO has put a spy on his team, he's even more determined to get to the bottom of what really went on, even if he has to bully his way out of a murder frame-up to do it. The moral dilemma Drummond faces when he learns the real story (and understands why the Army is so desperate to keep the cover-up going) reveals the man behind the maverick, and lifts Brian Haig's novel a cut above the genre. Haig might have spent more time making his secondary characters as interesting as his protagonist and tightened up his narrative. Still, fans of military thrillers will find this a good enough read. <i>--Jane Adams</i></p>BRIAN HAIG is the New York Times bestselling author of six novels featuring JAG attorney Sean Drummond.

His aphorism 'The unexamined life is not worth living' may have originated twenty-five centuries ago, but it is a founding principle of modern life. Socrates lived and contributed to a city that nurtured key ingredients of contemporary civilisation -- democracy, liberty, science, drama, rational thought -- yet, as he wrote nothing in his lifetime, he himself is an enigmatic figure.<br><br><b>The Hemlock Cup </b>gives Socrates the biography he deserves, setting him in the context of the Eastern Mediterranean that was his home, and dealing with him as he himself dealt with the world. Socrates was a soldier, a lover, a man of the people. He philosophised neither in grand educational establishments nor the courts of kings but in the squares and public arenas of Golden Age Athens. He lived through an age of extraordinary materialism, in which a democratic culture turned to the glorification of its own city; when war was declared under the banner of democracy; and when tolerance turned into intimidation on streets once populated by the likes of Euripides, Sophocles and Pericles. For seventy years he was a vigorous citizen of one of the greatest capitals on earth, but then his beloved Athens turned on him, condemning him to death by poison. Socrates' pursuit of personal liberty is a vibrant story that Athens did not want us to hear, but which must be told.<br><br>Bettany Hughes has painstakingly pieced together Socrates' life, following in his footsteps across Greece and Asia Minor, and examining the new archaeological discoveries that shed light on his world.

Socrates&#x2019; belief that, as individuals, we need to question the world around us stands at the heart of what it means to live in &#x2018;modern times&#x2019;. In the Socratic Dialogues, generated twenty-four centuries ago, we find the birth of <i>ethos</i> &#x2013; ethics &#x2013; and the identification of the <i>psyche</i>. &#x2018;The First Martyr&#x2019; &#x2013; the Greek <i>martys</i> means &#x2018;witness&#x2019; &#x2013; a witness to &#x2018;truth, virtue, justice&#x2019; and &#x2018;freedom of speech&#x2019;, is commemorated as a bedrock of our civilisation. Socrates stands at the beginning of our world &#x2013; when democracy and liberty are first conceived as fundamental values of society. We need to understand him because he did not just pursue the meaning of life, but the meaning of our own lives.<br><br>Socrates sees us coming. He worries that the pursuit of plenty will bring mindless materialism, that &#x2018;democracy&#x2019; will become just a banner under which to fight. What is the point, he says, of warships and city walls and glittering statues if we are not happy? If we have lost sight of what is good?<br><br>His is a question that is more pertinent now than ever. He asks: &#x2018;What is the right way to live?&#x2019;<br><br><i>I am a stinging fly, sent to goad the city as though it were a huge, thoroughbred horse,<br>which because of its size is rather sluggish and needs to be stirred.</i><br><br>When Socrates comes into focus, in Greece in the fifth century bc, he is no didact: he wanders through the streets of Athens, debating the essence of what it means to be human. For the young men (and women) of the city he is irresistible: his relentless questioning appears to tap man&#x2019;s potential for self-knowledge. His &#x2018;ethics&#x2019; programme centres on the search for the &#x2018;good life&#x2019;. His, it was whispered &#x2013; then and through the next 2,400 years &#x2013; is a voice of incomparable <i>sophia</i>: of knowledge, skill, wisdom and truth.<br>The greater part of Socrates&#x2019; life was spent out in public, in Athens, philosophising unrestricted. But when the philosopher was seventy, Athens turned against him. In March 399 bc the ageing citizen was tried in a religious court and found guilty of both primary and secondary charges: &#x2018;<i>not duly acknowledging the city&#x2019;s gods and inventing new ones</i>&#x2019; and &#x2018;<i>corrupting the youth</i>&#x2019;. The death sentence was passed: four weeks or so later Socrates killed himself by drinking the hemlock poison left for him by his jailer in his Athenian cell.<br><br>Socrates&#x2019; arguments were perhaps just too incendiary, too dangerously charismatic. He believed that man had the potential to enjoy perfect happiness. A clue to the contemporary impact of his ideas is given by his pupil Plato. In the <i>Allegory of the Cave</i>, with cool detail, Plato has Socrates describe a race of men who have been born in chains, and who, staring for ever at a cave wall, see only the shadows of creatures above them and believe these shadows to be reality. He then reveals the dismay and joy these captives feel when they are brought, blinking, into the light of the real world. The chained men represent those of humanity who have yet to hear or understand what Socrates has to say.<br><br>However, when it comes to wholeheartedly embracing the new, mankind displays a poor record. In a superstitious city, Socrates&#x2019; spiritual and moral make-up was unconventional, troubling. He seems to have suffered from some form of epilepsy or &#x2018;petit mal&#x2019; (hence his curious cataleptic seizures, when he stared into the distance for hours on end), which in a pious age was interpreted as a malign &#x2018;inner voice&#x2019;. His contemporary the playwright Aristophanes talks of the passionate men who go to hear him preach and<br>turn their minds to fundamental issues rather than frivolities as having been &#x2018;Socratified&#x2019;. And in his comedy <i>Clouds</i>, Aristophanes jeers at Socrates&#x2019; high-minded eccentricities, has him clamber into a raised bath and scramble around in the clouds to &#x2018;peer at the arse of the moon&#x2019;. Democracies need pragmatists, yet Socrates refuses to contain himself, to temper the power of principle. So pheme &#x2013; rumour, gossip &#x2013; starts to fly through Athena&#x2019;s city. As the robust philosopher is only too aware, a whispering campaign is the most pernicious and insidious of enemies.<br><br>These people who have thrown scandal at me are genuinely dangerous. They&#x2019;ve used<br>envy and slander and they&#x2019;re difficult to deal with. I cannot possibly bring them into court<br>to cross-question them or refute their charges. I have to defend myself as if I were boxing<br>with shadows.<br><br><b>Socratic thought and the living Socrates</b><br><br><i>In all cities, it is easier to hurt a man than to help him.</i><br>Plato, Meno, 94e<br><br>In the Metropolitan Museum in New York hangs a painting of Socrates, just before death, by the great neoclassical painter Jacques-Louis David. Socrates &#x2013; speaking slowly but determinedly, the hemlock about to run through his veins, a martyr to virtue and high principle &#x2013; is surrounded by agitated disciples. Crouched around his bed are those men such as Plato who will carry his words into literature and thus on into the very DNA of world civilisation.<br><br><i>Now it is time for us to go away, for me to die and for you to live; but which of us<br>is going to a better condition is not known to anyone except god.</i><br>This is not a book of philosophic theory. I am a historian, not a philosopher, and cannot possibly better the work of those who have gone before me, who have squeezed ever-evolving interpretations out of Socrates&#x2019; philosophical ideas; Plato, Aristotle, Diogenes the Cynic, Al-Kindi, Yehuda ha-Levi, Thomas Hobbes et al. &#x2013; all these men have tussled with what Socrates&#x2019; philosophy means. That is a bulging canon and one I would not presume to augment. But I can turn my eyes to the stones under my feet. I can see how Socrates&#x2019; philosophy evolved in his time and his place.<br><br>For the purposes of this book, the joy of Socratic thought is that Socrates did not believe in or deal with abstracts. For him, morality stemmed from and emerged to deal with real problems in a real world. The characters he employs as porters for his ideas are often cobblers, bakers, priestesses, whores. Socrates continually emphasises that he is flesh and blood, and that it is as a flesh and-blood man that he lived and understood life. It is one of the reasons his philosophy is so accessible to all of us. So bringing the humble, the archaeological and the physical back into the Socratic experience is appropriate. The totemic ideas that Socrates delivered were, put simply, as much to do with the religious ritual he had just witnessed down at his local harbour, with the pleasure of walking barefoot through Athens, with the death of a loved one, or the horror of living through a wasting-war, as they were with any kind of purely intellectual concept. Socrates&#x2019; prime concern was with the world as lived. As this book weaves together the mongrel evidence for his life, where material remains are as valued as literary and documentary sources, a picture emerges of a world that is, for the first time, self-consciously trying to build a &#x2018;civilisation&#x2019; that is based on a &#x2018;democracy&#x2019;.<br><br>Yet Socrates is not concerned just with our surroundings, but what is<i> within</i> us. &#x2018;<i>He who orders us to know ourselves is bidding us to become acquainted with our soul</i>.&#x2019; Socrates is soulful. The philosopher believes open conversation an essential balm for the psyche. His method gets inner thoughts out into the public sphere, not as a monologue, but as a dialogue. For him this was cathartic &#x2013; Plato uses the Greek word <i>katharsis</i>&#x2013; releasing &#x2018;bad things&#x2019; from the spirit. Socrates is the first man for whom we have an extant record who explores how we should all live in the world, as the world was working out how to live with itself.<br><br><i>Truth is in fact a purification [katharsis] . . . and self-restraint and justice and courage<br>and wisdom itself are a kind of purification.</i><br><br>Socrates&#x2019; philosophy is relevant to all of us, not least because it has been so tenacious. From Elizabeth I to Martin Luther King, from the Third Reich to twenty-first-century America, Socrates&#x2019; example has been used to try to understand what society is, and what it should be. Socratic words filled the halls of Italian Renaissance humanists. The Jewish philosopher Yehuda ha-Levi in the eleventh century ad cites Socrates in a dialogue with King Khazar concerning the nature of Judaism. John Locke and Thomas Hobbes scatter their treatises of political theory with Socratic quotations. Socrates was also a central influence in early Islam. Al-Kindi, the &#x2018;first&#x2019; self-professed Arab philosopher, certainly the first Muslim philosopher, wrote extensive (long-lost) treatises on Socrates in the ninth century ad.18 Socratic wisdoms were quoted in coloured stone, mortared into the very fabric of public buildings in Samarkand. The philosopher was nominated one of the Seven Pillars of Wisdom, his nickname &#x2018;The Source&#x2019;. Socrates&#x2019; inner voice was thought by medieval Muslims a sign that he was an angel in poor man&#x2019;s clothing. Throughout the Arab world from the eleventh century ad up until the present day he was said to refresh and nourish, &#x2018;like . . . the purest water in the midday heat&#x2019;.<br><br>And yet why should we still care for him? Why commemorate this longago life? One good reason is because Socrates does that shocking thing &#x2013; that thing we still crave &#x2013; he implies there might be a way to be fulfilled on this earth. Socrates was magnetic because h...</p><h2>The Urban Sketching Handbook Reportage and Documentary Drawing: Tips and Techniques for Drawing on Location (Volume 3) (Urban Sketching Handbooks, 3)</h2><p><p><b>Develop your own creative approach, no matter what your skill level with <i>The Urban Sketching Handbook: Reportage and Documentary Drawing.</i></b></p><p>The third volume in <i>The Urban Sketching Handbook</i> series, <i>Reportage and Documentary Drawing</i>, is about drawing as a form of journalism or documenting life.

In this gripping book internationally bestselling author Dr. Brian Weiss tells the extraordinary story of their love and explains that each of us has a soulmate whom we have loved in past incarnations, and who waits to reunite with us now.</p><p>Elizabeth was a beautiful woman who began past-life regression therapy for grief and relationship problems. With the help of Dr. Weiss, she delved into former lives, began to understand her present, and surprisingly, like Catherine in Many Lives, Many Masters, made contact with the Masters: highly evolved, ancient souls who, through her, channeled profound, crystalline messages for all people about life after death, spiritual dimensions, and the purpose of our lives on earth. At the same time, Dr. Weiss was treating Pedro, a charming man also suffering from grief. He, too, underwent past-life regression therapy to seek solutions and healing. Dr. Weiss had often worked with couples or families who discovered that they had known each other in previous lifetimes, with often shocking consequences. Elizabeth and Pedro, however, were present-day strangers. Yet they seemed to be describing the same past lifetimes with a stunning similarity of detail and emotion. Could they have loved each other and lost each other across time? In the answer to that question lay a gripping drama of which none of them - neither psychiatrist nor his patients - was yet aware, a drama that would nevertheless begin to unfold in the unsuspecting serenity of the doctor&#39;s office. It is a drama of life after life, of destiny and hope. It is a story that happens silently every day. This time, the world is listening.Dr Brian Weiss is a psychiatrist who lives and practises in Miami, Florida. For the past few years his work with regression therapy has led him to research the concept of past lives and he conducts seminars and experiential workshops.</p><h2>A Haiku for Hanae</h2><p>Japan&#39;s star detective returns--this time in a flashback to his salad days--to solve the case of a Morman missionary who is found slain in a Shinto shrine</p><p>Among the strangest and most engaging in Melville's Japanese mystery series, the 10th recalls Inspector Otani's stay years earlier, on Awaji Island, far from home and his wife Hanae. There he is put in charge of a case involving a murder inside the island's Shinto shrine. Otani learns that the victim, a Mormon missionary from the U.S., was supposedly knifed by a "fox-possessed family," the Suekawas, who own the inn where Otani stays. When he witnesses an exorcism of the evil spirit that forces humans to do its mischief, Otani is awed by the rites that challenge his disbelief, and uses facts disclosed in the magic event to find the killer among the large cast of colorful characters. But he can't solve a more troubling mystery. On the night when he drank too much, did he or didn't he fall for seductive Mrs. Suekawa? The question is the inspiration for the haiku to his beloved Hanae. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Gifford Pinchot: American Forester (First Book)</h2><p>A biography of the forester who helped to found and develop the United States Forest Service</p><p></p><h2>Blago Bung, Blago Bung, Bosso Fatakal: First Texts of German Dada (Anti-Classics of Dada)</h2><p>The German contribution to the Dada movement ("DADA MEANS NOTHING!" proclaimed Tristan Tzara) as it unfolded in Zurich during the first World War is not widely known.This collection brings together three texts translated into English for the first time, which were essential for the very creation of the movement, and which influenced all its future developments in France, Germany, the USA and many other countries. <p>Included is the only Dada novel, Tenderenda the Fantast, written by the movement&#x2019;s founder Hugo Ball. sections of which he performed at the celebrated Cabaret Voltaire. It is partially a roman � clef recounting the birth of Dada and the author&#x2019;s subsequent love-hate relationship with his monstrous creation, and yet is much more besides. Richard Huelsenbeck&#x2019;s Fantastic Prayers was the first Dada poetry collection, and these precocious "Bruitist" poems clearly illustrate how the absurd elements in early Expressionism evolved into the bizarre eloquence of Dada. Finally, Walter Serner&#x2019;s Last Loosening manifesto, the first major German manifesto written in Zurich, which provoked numerous brawls at its various performances and yet is hardly known.

He is the author of twelve collections of Rumpole stories and three acclaimed volumes of autobiography.Mortimer, a retired barrister and creator of Rumpole, retains his high good humor in this third charming autobiographical volume (whose title comes from Byron's Journals), even if, as he confesses at the start, he's reached an age when he can no longer put on his socks. ("The situation is, in minor ways, humiliating and comical.") A superb raconteur, the author never forgets that his first duty is to entertain. In a series of short, conversational chapters, which proceed in an artfully haphazard way to cover recent experiences (such as selecting a coat of arms) as well as childhood memories (mainly of his blind father, a judge), he recounts one amusing anecdote after another. These can be racy, as in the priceless transcript of a lurid sex case tried with straight face before the very proper House of Lords. More serious concerns such as prison reform are also in evidence. Mortimer chronicles his involvement in various good causes, from saving London's Royal Court Theatre to finding a suitable statue to top a vacant plinth in Trafalgar Square. A visit to his dying first wife, Penelope, is especially poignant. Travel filmmaking with Franco Zeffirelli in Italy, dealing with panhandlers in New York also receives his humane and humorous attention. By the end, Mortimer makes it clear that, despite his infirmities, he has not lost his zest for life. This is a most civilized and witty book by a most civilized and witty man. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Pre Level I Physics Teacher&#39;s Manual</h2><p>Teacher&#39;s manual for the Pre-Level I Physics Laboratory Workbook.

In studying the natural and human forces that shape the rivers and mountains of that region, geologist David Montgomery has learned to see the evolution and near-extinction of the salmon as a story of changing landscapes. Montgomery shows how a succession of historical experiences -first in the United Kingdom, then in New England, and now in the Pacific Northwest -repeat a disheartening story in which overfishing and sweeping changes to rivers and seas render the world inhospitable to salmon. In <i>King of Fish</i> , Montgomery traces the human impacts on salmon over the last thousand years and examines the implications both for salmon recovery efforts and for the more general problem of human impacts on the natural world. What does it say for the long-term prospects of the world's many endangered species if one of the most prosperous regions of the richest country on earth cannot accommodate its icon species? All too aware of the possible bleak outcome for the salmon, <i>King of Fish</i> concludes with provocative recommendations for reinventing the ways in which we make environmental decisions about land, water, and fish.</p><p><b>David R. Montgomery</b> is Professor of Geomorphology at the University of Washington. His research focuses on landscape evolution, including the impact of erosion and sedimentation on biological systems. A member of advisory committees to governmental bodies and private organizations dedicated to protecting rivers and wildlife, Montgomery lives in Seattle with his wife Anne, and his field assistant Xena, a black lab-chow mix.Drawing on a combination of scientific, historical, sociological and political research, Montgomery, a professor of geomorphology at the University of Washington, traces the tragic and steady decline in salmon populations in Europe, New England, Eastern Canada and the Pacific Northwest. Using his detailed analysis of the destruction of native salmon runs at each site, Montgomery demonstrates that the decline has been caused by the same four actions: polluting rivers in the name of technology, changing the natural environment by damming rivers and clear-cutting forests, overfishing, and ignoring regulations and laws imposed to help salmon populations recover. Montgomery's history of salmon moves from awe inspiring (their ancestors go back some 40 million years) to heartbreaking ("Lonesome Larry was the only sockeye [salmon] that made it back [to Redfish Lake] in 1992"). But when the book's focus changes from fish to the likes of Queen Anne, King George, Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford, who were all unsuccessful in stopping the salmon's slide toward extinction, Montgomery's tone becomes decidedly bleaker. Though the nature of the salmon's struggle to survive against these recurring threats to its life and habitat causes the book to be somewhat repetitive, Montgomery saves his best writing for the last chapter, where he courageously outlines the scientific evidence surrounding the salmon's plight and presents a no-nonsense plan for the fish's tenuous hope for survival.

In <i>Cute, Quaint, Hungry and Romantic,</i> the writer whom Steven Millhauser called "the most original essayist since George Orwell" examines with devastating wit and in a style distinctly his own the contagious appeal of that which is not art, the uses of the useless, the politics of product design and advertising. Here is a psychic voyage into the aesthetic unconscious of the consumer, as well as "the perfect companion for any foray through Restoration Hardware or the freezer compartment at Dean &amp; DeLuca" (<i>Village Voice Literary Supplement</i>). From teddy bears to Mars Bars to Leonardo DiCaprio, this is the refuse of consumerism unflinchingly&#x2014;and very entertainingly&#x2014;observed.</p><p>From his perch somewhere in Brooklyn, New York, essayist Daniel Harris launches a loquacious jeremiad against the way in which consumerism and its ideologies have insinuated themselves into our sense of self. <i>Cute, Quaint, Hungry and Romantic</i> is a critical examination of the everyday things that surround us--from washing machines to vitamin supplements, reproduction antiques to supermodels. Taking aim at cuteness, quaintness, coolness, the romantic, zaniness, the futuristic, deliciousness, the natural, glamorousness, and cleanness, he seeks to expose just how tangled is the web we have woven, his goal being to show "how the aesthetics of consumerism are the lies we tell ourselves to preserve our individuality." Buying a four-by-four does not make us roughriders or adventurers, despite the names such vehicles bear. We know this as we drive our Wrangler or Jeep through the smooth streets of suburbia, yet the off-road ads still appeal. The perversity is the way in which attempts at iconoclasm are themselves domesticated into corporate opportunity: dirty denim, pick-up trucks as general vehicles, "wackiness."<p> Harris is not a man to mince his words. The reader sits almost breathless in the face of his vituperation. For example, discussing teenagers and coolness, he writes: "The romantic movement's cult of the child has created a foul-mouthed enfant terrible who has turned the playground into a necropolis, where prematurely aged Byronic figures stagger from the merry-go-round to the seesaw to the jungle gym, striking poses of misery and ennui, convinced that their solemnity lends them an air of sophistication and maturity."</p><p> The critique is scathing and often penetrating. <i>Cute, Quaint, Hungry and Romantic</i> is a bracing read and a call to consciousness. Even the least sophisticated consumers know they are manipulated. Even the most sophisticated, Harris argues, do not really acknowledge how much they, too, are willing dupes.<i>--J.

Yet his writing reveals a ferociously independent figure at times violently opposed to the dominant political and literary tendencies of his age. Arranged in chronological order, this diverse selection of his poetry shows the development of Kipling&#39;s talent, his deepening maturity and the growing sombreness of his poetic vision. Ranging from early, exhilarating celebrations of British expansion overseas, including &#39;Mandalay&#39; and &#39;Gunga Din&#39;, to the dignified and inspirational &#39;If -&#39; and the later, deeply moving &#39;Epitaphs of the War&#39; - inspired by the death of Kipling&#39;s only son - it clearly illustrates the scope and originality of his work. It also offers a compelling insight into the Empire both at its peak and during its decline in the early years of the twentieth century.</p><p>Joseph Rudyard Kipling (1865-1936) was born in India, although educated in England.

During the Second World War, he enlisted in the Army Air Corps and became a fighter pilot and instructor. After the war, he moved to South Carolina. He was married three times, the third time to Jane Rogers Johnson, and had four children and two stepchildren. He wrote his first novel, I, the Jury (1947), in order to raise the money to buy a house for himself and his first wife, Mary Ann Pearce. The novel sold six and a half million copies in the United States, and introduced Spillane&#39;s most famous character, the hardboiled PI Mike Hammer. The many novels that followed became instant bestsellers, until in 1980 the US all-time fiction bestseller list of fifteen titles boasted seven by Mickey Spillane. More than 225 million copies of his books have sold internationally. He was uniformly disliked by critics, owing to the high content of sex and violence in his books. However, he was later praised by American mystery writers Max Alan Collins and William L. DeAndrea, as well as artist Markus Lupertz. The novelist Ayn Rand, a friend of Spillane&#39;s, appreciated the black-and-white morality of his books. Spillane was an active Jehovah&#39;s Witness.

Journeying from New Zealand to Japan via Thames-side barge gardens, Pearson focuses on the spirit of place as it emerges through geography, history, architecture and native flora, extrapolating this sense of place into a new gardening philosophy. Very far from conventional gardening books, <i>Spirit</i> radically expands the genre, inviting us to understand the act of gardening in the light of contemporary needs and with a keen environmental awareness; Pearson particularly stresses the importance of skills such as being able to "read" a variety of landscapes (both wild and cultivated), and of staying open to what those landscapes suggest in terms of cultivation. This long-awaited publication is Pearson's first in eight years, and uses 400 of his own much-admired photographs as reference points. <b>Dan Pearson</b> began his career as a professional designer in 1987. He is co-author of <i>The Essential Garden Book</i> (with Sir Terence Conran) and author of <i>The Garden: A Year at Home Farm</i>.
